Mr. Michael Foot has put down a resolution on the subject and he is to be backed by Mr. Will Griffiths , 0M P for Manchester Exchange . Though they may gather some Left-wing support , a large majority of Labour M Ps are likely to turn down the Foot-Griffiths resolution . Mr. Foot's line will be that as Labour M Ps opposed the Government Bill which brought life peers into existence , they should not now put forward nominees . He believes that the House of Lords should be abolished and that Labour should not take any steps which would appear to " prop up " an out-dated institution .

And they are unimpressed by the Germans' claim that they cannot pay more than 357million without upsetting their own economy . The Americans say Germany is having it too good and is not paying for the past or for the present . The Adenauer Government flatly rejected attempts by the Eisenhower Government to get them to pay a regular sum towards the cost of keeping American troops in Germany . These support costs are a big drain on America's dollar reserves . Dr. Adenauer's answer is the once-and-for-all cash offer of 357million . President Kennedy's rejection of it is a painful blow to the West German Government . It will now have to pay more - and increase taxation to do so - or run the obvious # risks in upsetting the new American administration .

George Brown CHILDREN TWO men who are poles apart in personality last night dominated Mr. Brown , passionate and warm-hearted , led Labour's attack on the higher health charges . Mr. Powell , white-faced and outwardly unemotional , replied with a statistical state- ment - and ended by inciting Labour M Ps to angry uproar .

For the Tories were massed in answer to their whips to defeat a censure motion on the Government for " undermining the Health Service " and placing heavy burdens on those least able to bear them .

Mr. Brown declared that the policy under censure was monstrous . It had offended many people far beyond the ranks of Labour supporters . The Press , many doctors and public were denouncing the proposals . He quoted from this letter which Mr. Gaitskell had received : " My background is a doctor of 68 , who has practised medicine for 43 years , chiefly as a panel doctor . " I am a lifelong Conservative . I am horrified and amazed by my party's proposal to prostitute the whole principle of the State service and to render that service a hardship to poor people . " After a lifetime of helping others and healing the sick , my considered opinion is that anybody supporting the increased charges is a wicked , old - . " Mr. Brown went on : " We are dealing with a noble edifice which needs an imaginative architect to improve it , but it has got a quantity surveyor . We have descended from the real problems to fiddling about with bills of cost .

Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the unsmiling Mr. . He demanded that instead of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should take ruthless action against the drug making industry , whose profits had risen by up to 400 per cent. in the last eight years .

Macmillan has picked a strong " brains trust " team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market . And he has abandoned plans to visit President de Gaulle this month to smooth the way . General de Gaulle's official welcome last week to Britain's moves towards the Six was taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall , but no more than that . So the idea of personal mission by the Prime Minister to Paris was dropped Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a hand-picked team under the leadership of Sir Pierson Dixon , Britain's Ambassador to France , to back Mr. Edward Heath , Lord Privy Seal , who is charged with the conduct of negotiations with the Six . At the same time the Prime Minister has offered Commonwealth Governments every facility possible to safeguard their interests Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys , Commonwealth Relations Secretary , that they wish to be kept in touch in London . Three of them - Canada , Australia , New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening meeting in London on Monday . Once the Common Market's Council of Ministers draws up the procedure for negotiations in a fortnight's time , these Commonwealth countries can arrange for observers to advise the British negotiating team . The team is composed of experienced negotiators in several fields . Sir Pier- son Dixon has a wide reputation as a skilful backstage negotiator since his days as Britain's chief UN dele- gate . Second in command is Mr. Eric Roll , 53-year-old Deputy Secre- tary at the Ministry of Agriculture , Food , and Fisheries . The Foreign Office is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay Other leading members are : Sir Henry Lintott from the Commonwealth Relations Office , Sir William Corell-Barnes ( Colonial Office ) , Mr. G. R. Bell ( Treasury ) , and Mr. G. H. Andrew ( Board of Trade ) . They will accompany Mr. Heath next month when he goes to Brussels , headquarters of the Common Market Commission , or wherever the Six decide negotiations should be held . Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville , French Foreign Minister , and Mr. Heath . MR. Selwyn Lloyd - a man with troubles enough back home - seems fated to fly into trouble abroad . Last year it was the riots in Istanbul , which enlivened the NATO Council meeting . Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in Ghana coinciding with the meeting of the Com- monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the first to be held in Africa . Only a few hours af- ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed at Accra this morning , hundreds of shop assistants demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway Stores , the largest in town . The stores had been hit by the same strike wave that has paralysed the port of Takoradi for the past week . Root of the discontent : The austerity Budget , including a compulsory savings scheme which the Ghana Government introduced in July . Ghana's strong man is not here to face the storm . President Nkrumah , having made his contribution to the neutrals' conference in Belgrade , has resumed his holiday on the Black Sea and no one here professes to know when he will return . But in his absence his chief lieutenants have not let him down . The strong arm of authority has been raised against the strikers and is now beginning to tell . Today's Ghanaian Times ( motto : " The welfare of the people is the supreme law " ) reports : " The Government has been urged to take immediate ac- tion to deal ruthlessly with the strikers . " The urge came from a conference of activists of Nkrumah's Convention Party " after powerful addresses by Comrades Krobo Edusei , Tawia Adamafio , " and others . Strong deeds followed strong words . In Takoradi a " limited state of emergency " was declared , giving the Government adequate power to maintain all essential services and ensure food supplies . Thus it becomes an offence punishable with imprisonment for anyone who " publishes a report likely to cause alarm or prejudicial to public safety . " And up to ten years' imprisonment can be imposed on anyone convicted of sabotage . These stern measures had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the strikers gave in , but in Takoradi , the chief storm centre , they are still holding out despite the presence of 1,400 police and 16 armoured cars . And how did the Government react when the strikers demonstrated in Accra ? At 9.40 Mr. Edusei , Minister of Transport and pro- bably the toughest man in Mr. Nkrumah's team , drove up to the Kingsway Stores and faced the demonstrators , most of them shopgirls in overalls . " If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock , " he told them , ' the police will act . ' At five to ten a posse of police arrived and in less than two minutes the crowd had gone . If the threatened " counter-revolution " was not * to bring the President back from his travels it might have been thought that the muster from the 13 States of the Commonwealth was an occasion worthy of his presence . After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this year the Economic Consultative Council should meet in Accra . * enough It has been left , however , to Mr. Goka , Ghana's Finance Minister , to do the honours as host , in which capacity he held a reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador Hotel . POLICE , on direct orders from the Cabinet , are openly intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear- disarming Committee of 100 , the Committee claimed yesterday . It said pressure was being put on members and associates all over the country . It alleged : Phones were being tapped and going out of action ; Police were visiting people " on no pretext whatsoever , except to pass the time of day " ; Supporters had been warned - one that his connection with the committee was going too far ; another that anti-apartheid agitation was all right , but support for the committee was not . A third man's house was watched for four days by plain-clothes men . Committee-member Mr. George Clark commented at a Press conference : " The most extraordinary things are happening . " Fifty committee members will appear at Bow-street today , including Lord Russell , Lady Russell , Lord Boyd-Orr , the Rev. Michael Scott , and Mr. Clark . They are required to show why they should not be bound over for disturbing the peace and for inciting a breach of the peace . The summonses say they are " likely to persevere in such unlawful conduct . " Lord Russell , 89 , was putting his affairs in order , and packing a case , at his Chelsea home yesterday . His secretary , American-born Mr. Ralph Schoenman , said : " He is not going to agree to be bound over . That will probably mean jail and , though frail , he is very fit and will take the rigours of prison in his stride . He hopes to be allowed to do some writing . " Back at the Press conference , Mr. Clark said two committee members tried a " plant " call on suspect phone . They discussed a sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. - none was planned but police turned up . Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Kenneth Kaunda . Sir Roy , Federal Rhodesian Prime Minister , said that Mr. Kaunda's United National Independence Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia National Congress , which was led by Mr. Kaunda until he was outlawed in 1959 . The record of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went back a long way , Sir Roy told the Federal Parliament in Salisbury . He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters had been arrested or convicted since last year on charges of creating disturbances . During the first three weeks of the present trouble 287 incidents had been reported in Northern Rhodesia . More than 500 people - 167 of them members of the UNIP - were convicted last month in the Northern Province alone . " Against this background must be taken Mr. Kaunda's repeated statements that all he is doing is in the name of non-violence , " said Sir Roy . " I am now compelled to say that I don't accept his good faith . " He said Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements had stimulated violence , but he had done nothing to stop it . " It is true he made a point of again being absent from Northern Rhodesia when his followers have indulged in such violence . " But Sir Roy pointed out that a few months ago Mr. Kaunda said that if UNIP did not get its way what would happen would make the Mau Mau in Kenya " seem like a child's picnic . " JOHN DICKIE writes : Mr. Macmillan gave top priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his return from Scotland yesterday . He summoned Mr. Iain Macleod , Colonial Secretary , and Mr. Duncan Sandys , Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks at Admiralty House . A statement is expected today to hold the door open for modifications to the new Constitution provided law and order is maintained in Northern Rhodesia . Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting problem . Mr. Sandys has warned of the risk of a strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the African nationalists . Mr. Macleod has ample evidence from talks with Sir John Moffat , Northern Rhodesian Liberal leader , and Mr. Kaunda , that the bulk of moderates and Africans will reject the Constitution unless it is modified . A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of Buganda ( King Freddie ) from Princess Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro , kneeling at the foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport yesterday . Forty other Africans greeted him , kneeling with heads bowed . The princess , aged 24 , is now studying history at Cambri- dge , where she is a friend of Prince William of Gloucester . King Freddie and three other hereditary rulers of native kingdoms in Uganda arrived for talks with Colonial Secretary Mr. Iain Macleod , before the Uganda Constitutional conference opens next Monday . The question : Their status in an independent Uganda . The thorniest problem for next week's conference is to settle the relationships between them and the rest of the country . A Government report has recognised their rights and recommended a form of federal association , but the four kings are not Instead , the kings will remain in London and wait to hear the conference's proposals . Then their views will be transmitted back . MR. BUTLER , the Home Secretary , has decided to meet head-on the biggest challenge to Government authority yet presented by the " Ban-the-Bomb " demonstrators . Police leave has been cancelled and secret plans prepared to deal with the mass sit-down rally planned for Sunday in Parliament-square by the Committee of 100 , the anti-nuclear arms group . It was Mr. Butler who authorised action which ended yesterday in 32 members of the Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting a breach of the peace . The committee's president 89-year-old Earl Russell and his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for a week . Playwrights Arnold Wesker ( The Kitchen ) and Robert Bolt ( The Flowering Cherry ) were jailed for a month . The possibility that the Government might invoke the Public Order Act , 1936 , and declare the whole rally illegal - whether the demonstrators sit down or not - was being discussed in Whitehall last night . It was last used a year ago , to deal with the St. Pancras rent riots . Today Mr. Butler will have talks with Police Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to draw up final plans for the " Battle of Parliament Square . " Measures agreed so far include : 1 . A mass call-out of police , special constables and reserves , with 750 policemen posted from outlying districts to stations in the area - West End Central , Bow-street , and Cannon-row . Today , for example , the Foreign Minister of Indo- nesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav Foreign Minister . In fact such Yugoslav activity has been # particularly intensified in the past year or so and though so far , apart from joint action in the United Nations , these exchanges have not been seen on any wider basis , President Tito is known for some time to have favoured a conference of neutralist leaders . The wish was particularly apparent in comments on the occasion of the conference in Casablanca and , in particular , in Yugoslav approval of the idea of an inter-African consultative assembly which would coordinate activity on the political and economic sphere ; and it is not difficult to see that President Tito would like some such idea extended also to the whole uncommitted world But he now feels , in view of a changed international situation and especially in view of fresh problems facing the new and independent countries of Africa , that the time is ripe to have more frequent consultations between the uncommitted countries and even to work out common stands on various problems facing those nations . Two subjects , the Congo and Algeria , are the main topics of the talks in Belgrade - and on both the two leaders have identical ideas . Two emissaries from the Laotian Government of Prince Boun Oum have arrived in Phnom Penh , Cambodia , to invite Prince Souvanna Phouma , the former Prime Min- ister , to return to Laos . No details of their mission have been disclosed , but it was reported earlier in Laos that Prince Boun Oum was considering asking Prince Souvanna Phouma to join his Government . Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to the mission , but recent statements made by him in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards himself as the only legal Prime Minister of Laos . His policy of strict neutrality from 1951 to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace , though at the cost of virtual partition of the country into the pro-communist north and the pro-western centre and south . Prince Souvanna's former Minister of Information , Mr. Quinim Pholsena , who claims to be his representative in Laos , yesterday addressed all officers of the pro-communist forces occupying the province of Xieng Khouang and emphasized that Prince Souphannouvong , leader of the pro-communist Neo Lao Haksat Party , also to the officers in the same terms . This emphasis on the legality of the former Government suggests that all is not well with the political and military leadership of the pro-communists . Most of the province of Xieng Khouang and the tactically useful Plain of Jars , however , appear still to be firmly in their hands . The Government has claimed the recapture of Vang Vieng , the pro- communists' former base 60 miles north of Vientiane , but this claim A correspondent who travelled yesterday to within a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by officers that this village was still held by the pro-communists . With the Prime Minister sunning himself in Jamaica and # his Cabinet out in the grass roots making 160 speeches in 80 constituencies in 10 days , the Liberal Party are holding a national conference here with some 2,000 delegates , the biggest gathering since 1958 when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party leader . In some ways it will be a testing occasion for him , although some think his position unassailable simply because there is no one else in sight to supplant him . So the con- ference will concentrate on laying the foundations on which to win the next election . The rally comes at a time when in spite of carefully worded state- ments by the Prime Minister there is an air of electoral expectancy . Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks which outlines in some detail the accomplishments of the party since it came to office three and a half years ago . Nevertheless there is little illusion in the Conservative Party that their stock at home has fallen in the face of heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy . Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative provincial governments , Quebec and New Brunswick , and in the four federal by-elections last October the party fared badly . They are now faced with four other by- elections , one at Esquimalt Saanich , British Columbia , one in Leeds , Ontario , and the other two in the Maritimes - Restigouche Madawaska , New Brunswick , and Kings , Prince Edward Island . All four were Conservative strongholds . Last September a public poll showed that for the first time since the Administration came to power in 1957 the Liberals were ahead ( 43 per cent were in favour of " The Grits " if a federal election had been held last autumn , 38 per cent for the Conservatives and 12 per cent for the C.C.F. ) . However , a separate poll revealed that Mr. Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of popularity as an individual leader ( for Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent , for Mr. Pearson 34 per cent ) . How far is Mr. Lester Pearson acceptable to the people of Canada as a Prime Minister ? Many observers at the national rally will be seeking an answer . It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson in the role of a popular orator at the hustings , the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen- baker was in the last two campaigns . The impression remains that the Liberal leader is still the diplomatist , more at home in the chancery , or the corridors of the United Nations , not the father figure , so necessary in Canadian leadership , or the practical politician , able to talk about sewage problems in Algoma East . On the other hand , Mr. Pearson excels in meeting people informally , but many still regard him " as some sort of cross between an egghead and a missionary " . His party advisers are now trying to correct that image . The bow tie has gone ; he is having lessons on television techniques and is being coached by speech experts . Everything is being done to promote a new image . Certainly , he is now a much lessly trounced by Mr. Diefen- baker in the House in those early days . It has been a hard road back but now , with plenty of political ammunition given him by the Gov- ernment in recent sessions , he is leading the Opposition with skill and assurance and is a match for the Prime Minister across the floor . Sentence Database Mr. Pearson is now talking about " his new and dynamic liberalism " and this week will # show perhaps how far " Mike will go . The main topic under review is unemployment , but there will be 21 committees examining subjects ranging from foreign investment in Canada to the problems of the Atlantic provinces . However , be this election year or not , Mr. Pearson , with his party increasingly confident of return to power , Sentence Database Mr. Thorneycroft , the Minister of Aviation , who arrives in Bonn tomorrow for talks with the Federal Government on a European space satellite project , will find the Germans interested in the principle of space research , but rather sceptical about British plans for organizing it . Stated more bluntly , they are still unconvinced that this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to salve Blue Streak , which was abandoned last summer as a military project ; or that the European space satellite is indeed to be purely scientific in character . Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to remove these doubts , and to persuade the Federal Government that the financial burden involved is really worth while , at a time when any increase in budgetary commitments would almost certainly involve a corresponding rise in taxation - something no one is prepared to contemplate in an election year . But , at the same time , there is reason to believe that the Federal Government is not convinced , on the basis of the information it has so far , that such a project would be justified from a scientific point of view ; and not merely constitute a " prestige " satellite , duplicating to some extent American efforts , as Die Welt suggests today in a highly critical editorial article . On the specific question of the use of Blue Streak , Mr. Thorneycroft's task will be easier . He can point out that this is the only rocket and launcher in Europe to have reached a sufficient stage of development for adaptation as the first stage in putting a heavy satellite into outer space . There has also been some talk of adopting another British rocket , Black Knight , for the second stage , but the French have one of their own called Veronique which they would like to see used . The Foreign Ministry spokesman added today , however , that the Brussels Treaty was irrelevant , because research on the various rocket stages had already been concluded , and only cooperation on the type of capsule was involved . A lesser obstacle to German participation is the absence of any Ministry or Minister directly responsible for it - and therefore of any budget under which funds could be appropriated . This is expected eventually to replace the Fiat G-91 , and the F 104 Starfighter , the backbone of the German Air Force . PRESIDENT KENNEDY renewed his pressure on Mr. Harold Macmillan to join the Common Market during their talks at Admiralty House , Whitehall , yesterday . Much of their three hours , 20 minutes of discussion is believed to have been devoted to this main point of American policy . It arose during talks following President Kennedy's report to the British Prime Minister of the outcome of his recent visit to Paris . There General de Gaulle had made clear that he would accept Britain into the Common Market only if there were no conditions laid down to meet the Commonwealth and other reservations . Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still wanted him to apply for membership of the Common Market , even if it meant an unconditional surrender . There were also brief discussions on Laos , Berlin and other foreign questions , after Mr. Kennedy had informed Mr. Macmillan of his discussions with Mr. Krushchov . With the exception of 40 minutes when Lord Home , Foreign Secretary , and Mr. McGeorge Bundy , the President's special assistant for security affairs , were brought in , the two men talked alone . An attempt to get more information about the Admiralty House meeting will be made in the House of Commons this afternoon . Labour M.P.s already have many questions to the Prime Minister asking for a statement . President Kennedy flew from London Airport last night to arrive in Washington this morning . He is to make a 30-minute nation-wide broadcast and television report on his talks with Mr. Krushchov this evening . The joint communique on Mr. Kennedy's and Mr. Macmillan's third talks - the first were at Key West , Florida , the second in Washington - said : " Their discussions covered the major problems , both economic and political , and revealed once again the close agreement of the two Governments in pursuing their common purposes . " Occasion was given to review the need for economic co-operation and expansion in the general interests of developed and underdeveloped countries alike . " It said that the President and Premier noted " with satisfaction " the agreement in Vienna on the need for an effective Laos ceasefire , which should lead to progress toward a Laos agreement at the Geneva conference . " Particular attention was also given to the nuclear tests conference and to the question of disarmament . " The situation in regard to Germany was reviewed , and there was full agreement on the necessity of maintaining the rights and obligations of the allied Governments in Berlin . " Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks , followed by lunch given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other guests present , Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more times yesterday . In PARIS , Mr. Dean Rusk , U.S. Secretary of State , gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the 15-nation Nato council . Some of his listeners said he was " rather pessimistic " and talked of a Berlin crisis later this year . From Nato headquarters Mr. Rusk went to see President de Gaulle and informed him of the Vienna outcome . Last night Mr. Rusk arrived in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to fly home with the President . In DUESSELDORF , Chancellor Adenauer said the Vienna talks " might be the beginning of a slight improvement , " but no big changes should be expected in the political situation . RELAXED , smiling and clearly in the best of spirits , Mr. Krushchov yesterday returned to Moscow after his two days of talks with President Kennedy , writes Dennis Ogden from Moscow . The good beginning made at Vienna must be followed up by new efforts for peace , the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda declared yesterday . Events in Vienna " gave hope to people of goodwill who hate the cold war , and to all who are striving for a stable peace , " " Thinking over the results of the Vienna meeting , peace-loving people will say ' a good beginning . ' " Mr. Krushchov remained at the airport to join President Brezhnev in welcoming Dr. Sukarno , President and Prime Minister of Indonesia , who arrived by Boeing 707 jet on a state visit 40 minutes after Mr. Khrushchov had arrived from Vienna . A cheering , delighted crowd of Indonesian students broke through crash barriers to surround their President on the tarmac for In VIENNA , before flying off to Moscow , Mr. Khrushchov said he hoped his weekend talks with President Kennedy would # help " to establish an enduring peace between nations . " Replying to a farewell speech from Austrian President Schaerf , the Soviet Premier thanked Austria for the hospitality and welcome he had received . " The Soviet Union has always striven and is striving to safeguard an enduring peace for the peoples , to secure an early solution of the MR. GAITSKELL today delivered a full-blooded defence of the Polaris missile base . And by implication he supported the establishment of sites in Britain for the training of German troops . His main theme was that nuclear weapons were necessary to defend Britain , that Britain must depend on Nato and " the West " must have nuclear weapons so long as the Soviet Union has them . Addressing the annual congress of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers , he said he felt sure the Labour movement was coming round in support of his views . Obviously conscious of the fierce and widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in Britain , Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on to the missile . Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could not deny facilities to nations to which it was allied . But governments should be free to negotiate and refuse proposals with which they did not agree . The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles , because , he said , they were out of date and vulnerable and would attract enemy action . That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine . So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons , the West , somewhere , must have them too . It was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory purposes to be under the sea rather than on land . This was why the Labour Party did not think it right to oppose the Polaris depot ship . The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base in the Holy Loch , only 30 miles from Glasgow , a city with two million people . It should be sited in a more remote area . Mr. Gaitskell added that the Scarborough conference decisions did not , in his view , truly reflect the opinions of the majority of party members and still less the party's supporters in the country . Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the unilateralists was not possible , though he respected their views . He saw by reports that " those who organise these things " were recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament to shift the emphasis of their intervention away from straight opposition to the official document on to opposition to the Polaris base . To Mr. Macmillan , Mr Gaitskell said the Prime Minister should begin to take seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear weapons within the Nato alliance . " Let us say to Macmillan that he should press , I hope with the agreement of Kennedy , in talks with the Soviet Union , for the establishment in central Europe of a zone of controlled disarmament . " He thought , he said , that the Soviet Union would be prepared to reach an agreement on a zone of controlled disarmament in Europe . Mr Gaitskell concluded , declaring that the present was the beginning of a great period of opportunity for the party . It was a great chance that should be grasped . Inter-union jealousies prevent the fulfilment of a common policy for wages and other major questions , Mr. Jack Cooper The General Council of the Trades Union Congress should therefore consider the matter . Consideration should also be given to the regrouping of unions and the modification of their structures to meet the growing concentration of capital . Mr. Cooper argued that a common industrial contribution was urgent - particularly in unions serving workers in the same industry - along Suggesting that a total T.U.C. membership of eight million was a " poor show " compared with some countries , he argued that the position needed examination . BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr. Macmillan yesterday morning he was given the views of a wide section of the British people about Polaris submarine bases in this country . An open letter written by Earl Russell hoping that the Earl Russell , President of the Committee of 100 , told Kennedy that he should take notice of " that very large and growing section which is opposed to the establishment of a Polaris base , whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on British territory . " He pointed out that already there have been protests but that " very much larger protests are to be expected and are being planned . " There are three kinds of reasons that justify the protests and these should carry weight with the U.S. Government , Earl Russell suggested . " The first of these reasons is the importance of pre- serving the hitherto cordial relations between the U.S. and Great Britain , not only in Government circles , but in public opinion . " Earl Russell says it is inevitable , though profoundly regrettable , that the agitation against the Polaris base has generated some antagonism to the policy of the United States . The second reason is concerned with doubts as to the safety of the people of Great Britain ; " in the time of crisis it would probably be impossible for the British authorities to exercise any degree of control over the action of Polaris submarines . " He argues that there is a distinct possibility that so long as there is a Polaris base in Britain the Soviet Union might retaliate against Britain alone . " Such retaliation might , and probably would , destroy the whole population of Britain in the course of , at the most , an hour " without provoking American retaliation . Earl Russell believes : " It is very questionable whether British membership of Nato and British permission of American bases on our territory add anything to the strength of America , while , on the contrary , they impose upon America an onerous obligation which it may prove impossible to fulfil . " The third reason is that the supreme interest for the whole world - East and West and uncommitted nations - is the prevention of nuclear war . " A rapidly growing body of opinion in this country believes that Britain could be more effective in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral by helping to suggest agreements which could be accepted by both East and West . " THE next White Paper on defence , to be published in March , is likely to contain a five-year plan for the three Services . Its aim will be to produce superbly equipped , all-Regular forces of about 400,000 men . The three Services would be " integrated " to a greater extent than ever before . Short of wearing the same uniform , which is not contemplated , the Navy , Army and Royal Air Force would become , for practical purposes , a single defence force . There would be complete co-operation at all levels in training and operations . This would apply also in the command structure and central administrative organisation . Mr. Watkinson , Minister of Defence , has been working on the plan for some months , with the Prime Minister's approval . He has had numerous meetings with the Service Ministers . He has also had talks with the Earl of Home , Foreign Secretary , and with other Ministers concerned with overseas aspects of defence policy . Details of the scheme are now being worked out by the Chiefs of Staff , a process that may take four or five months . The scheme will be subject to Cabinet approval . Mr. Watkinson remains con- vinced that the policy initiated in 1957 , in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister of Defence , is still correct . This was to return to the tradition of all-Regular voluntary forces , with the last National Serviceman out of uniform by the end of 1962 . The Minister regards the recent trend of recruiting figures as encouraging . He is confident the aim can be achieved . While the possibility of an eventual return to National Service in some form cannot be entirely discounted , he does not agree that the point has been reached where this need even be considered . If National Service is ever resorted to , engagement would probably have to be for three years . It is thought this would be the minimum necessary for the extended training modern arms require and to enable each man to serve at least a year overseas . There is no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson is at odds with the Service chiefs over the decision to dispense with National Service , or over any other aspect of defence policy . Criticisms about Army manpower appear to have come mainly from retired officers who have held high positions but are out of touch with the existing situation . Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support from the C.I.G.S. , Field-Marshal Sir Francis Festing , who believes completely in the principle of an all-Regular army . Gen. Sir Richard Hull , who is to succeed Sir Francis , is equally convinced Mr. Watkinson is right . Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard as from Nov. 1 . The hand-over , due in September , was delayed because of the Berlin crisis . Mr. Watkinson and his advisers felt the change would be unwise at a moment # when attention had to be concentrated on possible need for important military operations . For this reason Sir Francis stayed on , and # sacrificed his leave . There was a computed 8.4 per cent. swing towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd , the Prime Minister . This implies the dis- appearance of the Progressive party from the House . Early results in yesterday's general election showed Nationalists being returned in their strongholds , like Bloem- fontein and the Transvaal , with slightly increased majorities . In the Cape , the veteran United Party politician , Mr. Harry Lawrence , standing as a Progressive , was The defeat of the leader of the Progressive party , Dr. Steytler , in Port Elizabeth South , announced immediately afterwards by the United party candidate , Mr. Plewman , left the Progressives deprived of both their chief figures . Dr. Verwoerd and the Leader of the Opposition , Sir de Villiers Graaff , have been returned unopposed . The contests were for 86 seats as 70 Nationalists and 20 United party candi- dates are unopposed . Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was evident that voters were bored by the Government's frequent appeals to the electorate . The election was the fourth in four years . In most constituencies it may go down as the most apathetic in the country's history . THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons last night that he had considered early in the Parliamentary recess whether to mobilise reserves necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing . He decided that it would be a great error to do so and to recall Parliament . But there would be no hesitation in mobilising if a further deterioration in the situation warranted such a step . It would have to be accompanied by other measures of a military , economic and political kind . Mr. Macmillan , who was winding up the foreign affairs debate , said the Government could not be party to accepting as a matter of principle the imposed division of Germany . " We must not be rattled into surrender , but we must not - and I am not - be afraid of negotiation . " Mr. Godber , Minister of State , Foreign Office , said earlier that the Government had asked the Medical Research Council to reassess the fall-out position in view of the Russian tests . The Council's findings would be made public . With a vigour and authority which delighted old Parliamentary friends and foes alike , the Earl of Avon , the former Sir Anthony Eden , in his maiden speech in the House of Lords last night , gave a warning that # appeasement over Berlin could only lead to war . To stand firm , he declared , was not to invite war , but the surest way to avert it . It was the end of a rather curious speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up the two-day debate on foreign affairs . He began in a low , almost chatty mono- tone , and his voice never rose to any accent of urgency . He passed in rapid review the United Nations Secretariat ; nuclear tests ; the canard about British interference with the United Nations in the Congo ; Kuwait ; and South-East Asia . He spent most of his short half-hour on Berlin . He deplored the possibility of some " new myth " about betrayal of Germany by the Allies . " We do not , " he said , " really know what the Russians want . " But he was certain that they wanted to establish a final and irrevocable division of Germany . Britain could not be a party to an imposed division . But negotiation , as the debate had shown , could be undertaken on a variety of bases . Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber- ately refrained during the summer from recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation by proclamation , such as would be necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine on to a fully active footing . That would have created a thoroughly unde- sirable atmosphere of panic . He thought that the situation was rather more hopeful . The Russians now realised its seriousness . The French doubts were more about procedure than about substance . The Prime Minister's attitude of studied calm brought down the temperature of the debate , which never at any time rose to fever pitch , to a remarkable degree of sub-normality . Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening in the Peers' Gallery . The early speakers in the debate each severely rated the speech of his predecessor . These strictures were all too well justified . We started with the plaintive wailings of Mr. Healey , " Shadow " Foreign Secretary , described by Mr. Godber , Minister of State , Foreign Office , as " pedantic and obscure on Berlin , damaging and obscure on the Congo . " In turn , Mr. Godber was censured by Mr. Shinwell , former Labour Defence Minister , for having read the The trouble about such debates is that they range too widely . They remind one of the Rugby match in " Tom Brown's Schooldays , " in which all the boys were welcome to take part , and only those who " really meant business " removed their jackets . Not many metaphorical braces were visible in the early stages of to-night's debate . Mr. Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's golf-course Press conference , which he described as " a display of flabby and A reference to the reunification of Germany brought a bark of " Start another war ! " from Mr. Ellis Smith ( Lab. , Stoke on Trent S. ) . Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet theme of limitation of armaments in Europe . This could , he suggested , be linked with prohibition of the production of atomic weapons in any part of Europe . Inspection and control would be much easier to establish in these territories . Mr. Healey denounced the Government for using double standards . Ministers had rebuked the unaligned nations for not condemning the new Russian tests , but they themselves had no condemnation for events in Angola or Algeria . It was not for the Government , said Mr. Healey , to take up moral attitudes , " especially when the temple of their religion is the bingo-parlour . " This puzzled such students of comparative religion as had failed to detect this cult . But Mr. Healey had a partial and limited success . He rallied behind him the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last night by his leader , Mr. Gaitskell . Mr. Godber's performance merited all the mild scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell . True , he did tell the House that the Government had asked the Medical Research Council to reassess the fall-out position in view of the Russian tests , and said that the council's findings would be published . He was not so happy in his defence of the Government's failure to condemn France for her nuclear tests in the Sahara on the grounds that they were only little ones . This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid and her illegitimate baby . For the most part , Mr. Godber muttered his way through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office brief . He resembles the elephant seal , an # otherwise endearing creature whose articulation is limited , we are told , to a series of heavy sighs . Sir Lynn Ungoed- Thomas , M.P. for Leicester N.E. , a former Labour Solicitor-General , and Mrs. Barbara It was signed by 60 Labour M.P.s , many of them Left-wing # sympathisers . It condemned " the pollution of the world's atmosphere as a crime against humanity . " A personal letter of protest against the tests from Canon Collins , chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament , addressed to Mr. # Khruschev , was also taken to the Russian Embassy . A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT writes : Ban-the- bomb demonstrators thronged the Central Lobby of the House of Commons last night and formed a queue stretching for more than 200 yards outside in Old Palace Yard . About 2,000 lobbied M.P.s and harangued them on disarmament . MR SELWYN LLOYD may speed up his plans to catch speculators in shares and property . The first hint of the Chancellor bowing to public opinion over his " July Budget " came dramatically in the Commons yesterday . Mr Lloyd said on # Tuesday that he proposed to deal in his next regular Budget with some profits which now escape tax . Sir Edward Boyle , Financial Secretary to the Treasury , said yesterday that the Government does not like retrospective legislation . He went on to describe the kind of people the Chancellor hopes to tax . These are people buying and selling shares within a short period , those " stagging " on a new issue and property dealers who form a chain of companies and put one property deal through each . Mr. Harold Wilson , Shadow Chancellor , jumped up to offer the Government an easy passage for such legislation . " Why don't you make proposals to legislate in the autumn ? " Mr. Wilson asked . " We wouldn't call it an Autumn Budget . You can call it a Taxation Management Bill , if you like . " While Mr. Wilson was speaking , the Prime Minister and Mr. Lloyd had a whispered conversation . They nodded at each other and Sir Edward rose to say that the Chancellor would bear Mr. Wilson's offer in mind . Guy Eden writes : Treasury experts are already working on the scheme . Profits of genuine investors in industry will not be affected , but only quick in-and-out speculator deals . FRANK FOULKES , Communist president of the ETU , refused yesterday to " commit suicide " at the TUC's invitation . He was announcing his executive's rejection of the ultimatum to the ETU. In reply to the call for his resignation he said : " Our rules say that if an official resigns he is not allowed to run again for three years . " I have only 2 1/2 years to go before I retire , so this is an invitation from my good friends of the TUC that I should commit hara-kiri . The other TUC demands : Five leading Communists must not hold office for five years ; Sub-committees set up to strip secretary John Byrne of his powers must disband in ten days . These the ETU executive rejected as " wholly unacceptable " and " unwarranted " interference . " But it agreed to postpone operation of the sub- committees . The small rocket craft , for destroying big ships , are controlled automatically , even to the preparations for launching their rockets . Applauding on the river banks at Leningrad were thousands now told that in 20 years they will have free food , housing , light , heat , transport and medical treatment - all for a working week of 34 to 36 hours . " The whole naval might of the Soviet Union can be seen here - a truly inspiring and proud sight , " said Moscow radio's commentator . The parade was reviewed by Marshal Andrei Grechko , commanding the forces of the Warsaw Pact countries - the Communist " Nato . " He said rocket- carrying atomic submarines now formed the basis of the Soviet Navy . MR. MACMILLAN'S announcement in the Commons of his momentous Mr. Anthony Fell ( Yarmouth ) called the decision " shocking " and added : " It is the most disastrous thing any Prime Minister has done for many , many generations . " He concluded : " The best service the Prime Minister can do would be to resign . " The outburst shocked MPs of all parties . Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell to stop . There were loud cries of " shame " from all parts of the Conservative side . Mr. Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat down . A few minutes later , Mr. Fell got up and left the chamber . He returned five minutes later to stand just inside the doorway looking more composed . In the middle of the amazing scene , Mr. Macmillan waved his hand at Mr. Fell . This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more . " I cannot be told to sit down by the Prime Minister . " Protests had been expected from Tory rebels . But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented . He accused the Prime Minister of " political double talk . " " It had the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime Minister is a national disaster , " he said . Most MPs agreed that Mr. Fell's attack had , if anything , rallied support to the Prime Minister . This apparently , was Mr. Macmillan's assessment . He confined his reply to the observation that Mr. Fell had probably " maximised his support . " There were no other attacks of such ferocity . But there was ample evidence of Conservative and Labour opposition , which will be aired in the debate tomorrow and on Thursday . As Mr. Macmillan made his announcement , the House was crowded . He said : " No # British Government could join the European Economic Community without prior negotiation with a view to meeting the needs of the Commonwealth countries , of our European Free Trade Association partners and of British agriculture . " Near the end of a long statement , Mr. Macmillan stated the Government's intention : " After long and earnest consideration , Her Majesty's Government have come to the conclusion that it would be right for Britain to make a formal application . . for negotiations with a view to joining the Community . " At this point , Mr. Paul Williams ( Cons. , Sunderland ) called out " Shame . " Mr. Williams is a close associate of Mr. Fell . He claimed that , unless we were in the Common Market , we should not be able to play any part in # determining its future . " We can lead better from within , " he said . Mr. Macmillan dealt with the main objection raised by Tory critics . Mr. Anthony Fell , who created a scene on this point on Monday , took up a position almost hidden behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair . Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help to the Commonwealth through the strength we would gain in the Common Market than by isolation . He paid tribute to the development of the Common Market . " The Community ( Common Market ) has imparted an impetus and an economic growth to The Six . Above all , it is an idea which has gripped men's minds , " he said . Referring to previous negotiations , Mr. Macmillan looked towards Mr. Reginald Maudling . " These were negotiations in which the President of the Board of Trade played a conspicuous part , " the Premier said . He dismissed the idea that Britain would be swamped by cheap labour . Our industry , he said , would probably gain . " Many people feel we have had , perhaps , too much shelter , " he went on . Conservatives protested when Mr. Gaitskell said he had been told this " by some # people of considerable authority , " he retorted . " I agree with the Prime Minister that I do not think we are necessarily bound for federalism in Europe , " he went on . If we joined the Common Market , our food subsidies would probably be replaced by a system of tariffs " That will mean a rise in the cost of living . " BUDGETTE or no Budgette YOU are spending more as the summer holiday season moves into top gear . On the eve of August Bank Holiday the spending spree is at a new all-time peak . Note circulation soared for the sixth successive week - this time by more than 15,000,000 # last week . And that brought the figure to a record 2,415,000,000 . This was 100,000,000 more than the corresponding week last year and 37,000,000 up on the 1960 record set last Christmas . Now look at the other side of all these coins . The big " squeeze " means that it is going to be more difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft . And banks will be stricter in recalling existing overdrafts . This is underlined in the Central Bank's weekly return ... ... which shows that more than 163,000,000 of the banks' money is now frozen in the form of special deposits with the Bank of England . Banks have paid in a first instalment of almost 8,000,000 in response to the Budgette appeal . About another 70,000,000 is due by September 20 . For nearly a year about 150,000,000 has been frozen . MR. KRUSCHEV raises the bogy of German militarism in his replies to the West on Berlin . And he repeats that the problem " must be solved this year . " The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to West Germany were published in Moscow yesterday . They tell : The U.S. - It is false to say the absence of a peace treaty with Germany causes no real danger . West Germany , with its militarists and revenge-seekers , is becoming a hotbed of war danger in Europe . Even now , aided by the U.S. , Britain and France , it has more than enough forces and arms to touch off a world war . BRITAIN - One cannot but wonder at British bases being put at the disposal of those very militarists who razed Coventry and barbarously bombed London and other British cities . FRANCE - One can hardly conceive the French are not alarmed ... . Next door , in West Germany , before everyone's eyes there has sprung up a regular army led by former Nazi generals and officers . With fire and sword France denies Algeria the right to self- determination and tramples on Tunisians' right to independence . WEST GERMANY - Russia would like to see a clear # realization that West Germany would not survive even a few hours of a third world war . The best way to rule out such a tragic contingency would be to sign a peace treaty to remove the cancerous growth of West Berlin's occupation status . Behind Bonn's slogan of German self- determination is the intention to impose on East Germany the regime existing in West Germany . REFUGEES are pouring out # of East Germany into West Berlin faster than ever . Mr. K's latest speech scared 1,157 East Germans to cross into West Berlin's reception centre DURING MONDAY NIGHT . And officials expect the total to leap to 3,000 a day . This figure has been surpassed only on the eve of the East German disturbances on July 17 , 1953 . And officials fear it may be too much for the city's refugee camps . They will overflow and private houses will have to be used . Prime Minister after Prime Minister speaks out in revulsion against the South African Government's policy of apartheid as we wait for the curtain to rise on the Commonwealth Conference in London . Will it end with South Africa's exclusion from the Commonwealth ? The issue is touch and go . There is a possibility that it will not be settled at this conference . It may be agreed to wait until South Africa actually becomes a Republic later in the year . But if a final decision is to be faced now , on which side do the strongest arguments lie ? THE Archbishop of Capetown has shown that the matter is not clear-cut . The Archbishop has long been a courageous fighter against apartheid . He must be heard with attention . On purely practical grounds he holds that it would be a mistake to expel South Africa , weakening the whites who are working for a change of policy . In his view it would also be against the interests of the Africans . He holds that more pressure can be put on South Africa while she remains in the Commonwealth than could be exercised were she cut off from it . On the other hand , those who favour expulsion , inclu- ding African leaders , feel that nothing less than the shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr. Verwoerd and the Nationalists . They point out that Dr. Verwoerd refuses to consider abandoning the apartheid policy . THE Commonwealth is a multi-racial society . A policy of racial discrimination in any of its countries is surely the one thing that it could not survive . Whatever statesmen say at the conference table in London , millions at home would regard as fraudulent a Commonwealth which had room for a racist South Africa . And this is a Commonwealth in which five citizens are coloured for every one who is white . Seen in this wider picture , a South Africa that clings to apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a liability to the whole Western world . A practical solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft a set of principles excluding race discrimination . And so leave South Africa to make the grade , or go out . THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home tonight from their tour in the East . The duke's trigger-finger and the ritual slaughter of beasts have taken the headlines in this country . Nevertheless , the tour has been an immense success . The Queen has won a triumph . It would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal performances as tiger and rhino hunts were dropped from future Royal programmes . But the Queen and the Duke have pleased millions by their visit . The warmth of their welcome in India and Pakistan are happy memories . WEST GERMANY - followed yesterday by the Dutch - has made the gesture of a good neighbour . She has put up the value of her money . Certainly , the rise is very small . But it is a step in the direction of live-and-let-live . Hopes will now grow brighter of further international co-operation , which is the only way to solve the payments difficulties that upset the Western world . Britain and the U.S. , which have problems with their balances , will gain some immediate help . What it means in practical terms is that our exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper for Germans to buy , while the goods which Germany exports will be made a little dearer . Booming Germany is deliberately encouraging more imports as a means to curb rising prices at home . She is also aware how # unpopular she has been growing by failing until now to co-operate as a creditor nation should . Germany exports much more than she imports . For upwards of five years the world's reserves of dollars have been drained into Germany . There they have stayed uselessly locked up because Germany has no tradition of trading abroad . In addition the strength of Germany's trading position has attracted speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars , hoping for the mark to rise , as has now happened . WILL the new valuation be enough to correct Germany's massive trading surplus and choke off speculation against dollar and pound ? That is doubtful . If however , in addition to her new good-neighbour gesture , Germany takes a really big share in giving aid to underdeveloped nations , the world outlook will be brighter . What gives rise to optimism is the sign that Germany and the other leading Western nations are at long last moving towards a solution of currency problems by co-operation . A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine , paid for by that curious body Moral Re-Armament . Those who lend their names to this kind of advertisement are worthy people , a little innocent of politics , perhaps , or carried away by the idea that moral regeneration would solve all our problems . So it would . While we are waiting for the millenium , however , most of us would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in instruments of democracy , such as trade unions and our local and national Parliaments . Should the Herald publish such advertisements ? This is a difficult question . It would obviously be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with which we disagree . When an advertisement contains statements whose factual truth is doubtful , or where the total content would be deeply repugnant to our readers , it is right to exercise editorial discretion . The MRA advertisement falls into neither category , though many readers will dislike it . The first reaction of the Sudanese Government was to denounce the United Nations for " negligence and impotence , " and to say that its 400 troops in the Congo would be taken home . The reaction can be understood . The Sudan's concern for its men is natural . But this could hardly be a # dignified exit . IF the UN is blamed for being weak , it would be more logical to send in more men , not weaken it further by desertion . It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr. Hammarskjold and the UN's servants . The responsibility rightly belongs to the nations which have undertaken the task of pre- serving peace in the Congo . That is not a ceremonial duty , and the soldiers have every right to blame the politicians unless they see it through . When the United Nations instructed Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to prevent civil war , it was clear that new dangers would arise unless it gave him the political ... That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold made . India has responded handsomely by providing 3,000 men , who must take about a fortnight to arrive . If the UN forces were thick enough on the ground , such incidents as that at Matadi would not happen . THE UN's ability to keep peace depends simply on adequate support by the nations which have set their hands to this plough . The big Powers involved in the Cold War must of course keep out . The Americans were justified in diverting naval ships in case non-combatant help was wanted ; but they stressed that there was no intention to intervene in fighting . Yesterday the ships turned away again , satisfied that they were not required . It is to be hoped that the UN will be re-established in their port by negotiation and that there will be no more outrages . But back , Mr. Hammarskjold is determined , they must go . The best news for the Congo would be agreement between its rival political leaders . Through the patient efforts of UN conciliators they are meeting for the first time , in Malagasy ( formerly Madagascar ) . THE world will sigh with relief when this strife-torn land gets itself a government which all outsiders can recognise . ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as " a policy of good neighbourliness . " We may be sure that he is not being hypocritical . That is what he really believes . A good neighbour to those Africans who , under apartheid , will be forced back to their tribal reserves with no prospect but a cramped and primitive existence . A good neighbour to those Africans who will con- tinue to live as hewers of wood and drawers of water in the white areas of South Africa , without rights and without hope . THE same sort of good neighbour that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from Hitler in the thirties . It was Dr. Verwoerd who led a protest against admitting any of them because they would " defile " the national white stock . It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver- woerd in his nightmare world . It is this that makes illusory any hopes that he may be in- fluenced to change course . The Archbishop of Capetown , Dr. Joost de Blank , has pleaded that South Africa should be allowed to stay in the Commonwealth . Otherwise , he says , those inside the country who still oppose apartheid will be left even more isolated and alone . The views of the Archbishop , who has maintained an unflinching witness to what Christianity really means , must carry weight . But what , in fact , can the other Commonwealth countries do to bring support and comfort to this gallant minority ? THERE is no evidence that the policy of appeasement has modified the actions of the Nationalists . On the contrary , apartheid is being applied ever more ruthlessly . The shock of expulsion from the Commonwealth now seems to be the only way left to try to bring home to the people of South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them to disaster . It may be that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers will decide against this final step . If that is their decision they should also go unequivocally on record that they regard apartheid as evil and indefensible . Unless they do at least that , Dr. Verwoerd will be able to return home claiming a triumph . His smile will be blander than ever . WE are in for it again : another Royal Wedding . Between now and June , when the Duke of Kent will marry Miss Worsley , hardly a day will pass without a story or a picture or probably both , about the nuptial arrangements . What seems certain is that those who advocate putting off any approach until Mr Krushchev gives evidence of a change of heart ( whatever that may mean ) would have us run risks greater than the West ought to run - and greater than President Kennedy's most influential advisers seem disposed to face . The real question is what we should put to the Soviet Government as a basis for talks : and On this reading what Mr. Gollancz calls manoeuvring , and what we should call cool-headed and inventive negotiation , is a means not to destruction but to safety . The Government's pompous little statement on Northern Rhodesia does not say much , but it says what is necessary - that the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is open to revision . This is news , however much the Government tries to disguise it by saying that the revision would be Formula One , which appeared in February , appeared to make this likely ; Formula Two , which appeared in June , made it very unlikely ; if Formula Three restores the original principle , that is all that need be required of it . It is a pity that the Government should ever have been led away from this principle . It is a great pity that the Government should give the appearance of responding , not to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations , but to the violence which he tried to prevent . To be able to say " New York next week " is an important advance . We must not be overconfident that this # meeting will lead on to further and decisive ones ; but without it , we could not look for them . Federal Germany votes tomorrow and not a day too soon . There can seldom have been an election campaign which more people in and out of the country wanted to see over and done with . To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their efforts to work out sensible ways of dealing with the Berlin crisis . It need not have been such a burden if Western Governments had not been convinced that they must do nothing to harm even remotely Dr Adenauer's chances of being returned as Chancellor . But they were so convinced and they have had to take the consequences . Mean- while in Germany itself the course of the campaign has dismayed a good many people : they too will be glad when the polling stations close . But discussion on current points of east-west con- flict could not go much farther than , for example , the truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament cannot be followed together . What the council has done - and it is an achievement - is to make religious con- tact across the greatest political barrier in what is not yet a unitary world . The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the agreement is signed . To this there will be some opposition . The Bill is short and modest in scope , and it is doubtful whether the other Private Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps . This fact may give the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the next report from the Molony committee . Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable . They should not , however , disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of parliamentary opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run . Centigrade v. Fahrenheit . The fight is on . The challenger has behind it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE for AIR but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the Meteoro- logical Office . The press and the broadcasting authorities are asked to help . To begin with , both tempe- ratures will be put in the ring together . SIR GRAHAM SUTTON , however , made no bones about it yesterday . The purpose is to give fahrenheit the knock out . The backers of centigrade would have got off to a better start if they had taken more pains to explain the advantages to the general public of the change . It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is at the moment " an awful mess up " in the measurement of temperatures . This , however , seems a matter of the convenience of specialists . The ordinary British man and woman is conscious of no difficulty . Rather than fifty million people having to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there any reason why the centigrade countries should not change to fahrenheit ? Can it be shown that the one scale is demon- strably better than the other ? The centigraders may be in for a stiffer fight than they think . They may have to call up the reinforcement of the Common Market . Even then it might be easier to persuade the British public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain circumstances the time would come when this would suit their convenience - rather than to change their system of recording temperatures . In any case , fahrenheit need not lose heart . Once before , and that not so long ago , the authorities ganged up to alter the habits of the people . That effort was to enforce the adoption of the twenty-four hour clock . Then , also , the B.B.C. were roped in . The only result was that the well-meaning corporation became very unpopular . A BAFFLED and bewildered little country stands at the centre of an international storm . Belgium is accused - without a scrap of evidence - of being implicated in the murder of Patrice Lumumba . Her leaders are insulted , her embassies are attacked in a score of countries . In Ghana , President Nkrumah , who has done more than most to stir up trouble in the Congo , orders every Belgian citizen to quit his country . HOUNDING Belgium has become an international pastime . Why ? Because those who said the Congolese could govern themselves will not admit they were wrong . So Belgium , bowed down by internal troubles , mourning a terrible air crash , is made their scapegoat . Who will speak for Belgium ? Who else but Britain . We have fought beside Belgium in two world wars . We are allies still . Britain should champion Belgium . Not with the careful , hooded language of diplomacy , but boldly and fearlessly . It is time to show the world that this country does not desert her friends . HAPPY , happy families ! Never before have Britain's larders been so well stocked . Supplies of meat and dairy produce were substantially higher last year than in 1959 . Lucky , lucky housewives ! To have such a splendid variety of goods to choose from . Not so long ago older folk were reminding young wives , # harassed by shortages , of the good old days of abundance . Now it is mother who picks up recipes from # her daughter . The dinner table is the best answer to the grumblers in Britain today ! " THIS is colour day , " proclaimed the American television network , N.B.C. And hour after hour it poured out its programmes in bright colours . In America colour TV is five years old . There are already 600,000 sets in use . What about Britain ? The B.B.C. is ready to launch a colour TV service , but the commercial TV contractors want to delay it for 10 years . The Government should settle this argument with two words to the B.B.C. : - Go ahead ! ONE man beyond all others is saddened by the deaths of two elderly sisters who killed themselves because they had to leave their cottage . Mr. John Crabb , clerk to Newmarket urban council , says : " I shall always feel this as a personal failure . " There is no reason whatsoever why he should reproach himself . The sisters had to quit as their home was falling down . And Mr. Crabb did his best for them , even driving them to a new house . John Crabb has the qualities of sympathy and understanding . Too often lacking in officialdom . MR. HENRY NEWTON of Acton does not want his daughter to marry a Scotsman . He says that the Scots are foreigners who have no business to be in England . The first ruler of the United Kingdom was a Scot . The Lord Chancellor is a Scot . The Prime Minister is a Scot - and so were four of his predecessors this # century . Let Mr. Newton beware . By protesting against Scotland he may be guilty of rebellion ! ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial . His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for five years . During this period Britain will be expected to subsidise and defend the Cypriots . They will enjoy all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference . It is a safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and company will sign on again . It is equally certain that the British Government will welcome them . How splendid it would be if , just for once , the Government were to voice the real feelings of the British people . And tell Makarios they are not prepared to accept him on such terms . GOOD cheer for the week-end . Ford Motors are to put 13,000 men back on a five-day week . One more demonstration of the industry's recovery . As springtime approaches , orders pick up . And the car men get ready for another bustling season . The pessimists said the motor industry was on its knees . The optimists said " Nonsense . " As usual , the optimists have been proved right . EARL RUSSELL and his friends have hit on an original way of spending this afternoon . They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence . It is their protest against the H-bomb . They ought to have a pleasant time . The weather forecast is good ; except for them , Whitehall should be deserted . And they will have a fine view of St. James's Park , with its placid lake , pelicans , rare ducks , and other wild life . Why not follow Lord Russell's lead today ? Head for the parks to enjoy the sun . Not in a foolish cause , but in a glorious one . Good health ! THIS group of men , says a report , work on average between 55 and 60 hours a week . They also put in an extra two or three evenings . And they never go on strike . Who are they ? The trade union officials of Britain . Men who earn only a fraction of what their talents and responsibilities could bring in the open labour market . The unions are fortunate indeed to find dedicated leaders at cut-rate prices . But it is time the members decided to pay up and be good employers . THE Labour Party says that the Tory Government is destroying the social services . Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the national income was spent on social services . The present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many worthwhile targets for the Opposition . What a pity to aim at the wrong one ! MRS. MARCIA POWER , whose husband made her clean his uniform , wins a divorce . The judge says she had to act almost as a serf . Up and down the country husbands will be saying they would never behave like that . But do they ever ponder how their gardening tools are mysteriously returned to the shed ; their books tidied ; and often , even their shoes cleaned ? How wonderful if they showed their appreciation this morning with a surprise box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers ! HOW the Government must repent its haste and folly in Rhodesia ! Eighteen months ago this territory was peaceful , orderly , and thriving . Africans within the Federal Government were getting valuable experience in administration . Then Mr. Iain Macleod became Colonial Secretary . Suddenly everything changed . Timetables were scrapped . The ill-conceived Monckton Commission was rushed out to Rhodesia . Overnight , minor African politicians were inflated into international figures . And as the British Government stepped up the pace of change , so the Africans stepped up their demands . TODAY , in London , that rash and thoughtless policy has caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened . No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching . If the Government now reverses its plan to give the Africans control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face difficulties from African politicians greedy for power . But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well be plunged into chaos , like the Congo . For Mr. Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice . They must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos . And try to repair the damage they have done . WHO can grow the fastest ? That is the exciting competition going on among Britain's major industries . Top of the table , at the moment , is the chemical industry . Then comes engineering , followed by iron and steel . Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the tremendous upsurge in investment . It reports that new factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent up on 1960 . Britain's business men are right to back their faith with cash . For expansion today means still greater prosperity tomorrow . BERTRAND RUSSELL , the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban- the-Bomb crusade , has devoted following . Thousands march with him - and sit with him too . It is said by some that he is a saint ; by others that he is a prophet . He is , in fact , a philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity who has been spectacularly wrong on the great issues of our time . BEFORE the war he urged the British people to welcome Hitler's troops as tourists . After the war he favoured a preventive war against Russia . Now he wants Britain to demolish her defences . Throughout the years Lord Russell and his supporters have been able to pursue their eccentric campaigns in freedom . They should ask themselves this question : How long would that freedom last if their policies were adopted ? AN experiment in courtesy is launched by the Electricity Board . The board is laying a cable along a seven- mile route in Surrey . A warden , Mr. Jack Finlay , has been appointed to smooth out difficulties for householders when trenches are dug outside their front gates . Splendid . By showing concern for the people the board will earn their good will . Happy patrolling , Mr. Finlay ! GOOD for Sir Roy Welensky ! The tough , resolute Premier of the Rhodesian Federation shakes the life out of his critics . He calls them " jelly-boned . " He promises to preserve federation against African fanatics and woolly minded individuals in the West . Some may ask : Is Welensky justified in being so harsh to those who disagree with him ? The facts answer that . CONTRAST his firm , successful rule in Rhodesia with what has happened in the Congo . There Welensky's opponents have carried their theories into practice . There a UNO army of Africans , bossed by an Indian , has been in charge for months . And what has it made of the Congo ? A bloodstained shambles . No wonder Welensky has lost all patience with his misguided tormentors . They have earned his strictures . And his contempt . SOME people are for ever complaining that teenagers earn too much and spend it all when they get it . Now a survey of the Post Office Savings Bank shows how wrong that idea is . The biggest group of depositors in the bank is made of boys and girls aged 15 to 19 . Certainly teenagers earn more than ever before . Certainly they spend more . But how splendid that in the most prosperous days in this country's history the old-fashioned virtue of thrift should still have a powerful appeal for young people . THE Danes are annoyed with British farmers for fighting against Danish competition . They say that our farmers do not seem to understand the meaning of free trade . There is no doubt what the Danes understand by free trade . It is that they should be free to sell as much as they like , while buying more and more from our rivals . Germany has now supplanted Britain as Denmark's principal supplier . The farmers of Britain understand free trade . That is why they fight it . THE Palace cinema at Buckley , near Chester , will be reopened next week by Barry Flanagan and Eric Platt , both aged 19 . Eric says : " We believe in the cinema . And we know what people want . " The combination of enthusiasm and shrewd anticipation of public taste has launched many great enterprises . Barry and Eric have enthusiasm . They are backed by a resurgent film industry . It could be curtain up on two success stories . Of the old Palace . And Barry and Eric . DONS at Cambridge want the study of agriculture to become an honours degree course . Farming is Britain's most vital industry . It is increasingly dependent on new techniques - and on the universities to provide men of knowledge and skill . The older universities are often accused of being interested only in dead subjects . Now Cambridge has the opportunity to show is just as interested in the living . Particularly as its rival , Oxford , has had a similar course in farming for 15 years ! JOHN GLENN , Virgil Grissom , Alan Shepard . One of these three men has a date with destiny - the first journey into Space . At the beginning of this wonderful century many people believed that there were no more worlds to conquer . Nobody 's going to shove 2ole Uncle Sam around ! " He then took out a piece of paper , wrote his address on it and added : " Anybody mucking the Yanks about had better call on me first . I won't stand for it . " Exit a puzzled American . The other incident occurred in the boat-train from Cherbourg to Paris . The travellers from the New World who had been in Britain many times before , were slightly stunned . Afterwards they said : " We thought we knew it all , but you Britishers never run out of unturned stones . " To the British Travel Association , doing their excellent darndest , I offer these sad complexities . IN the 1830's the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms and many a good trade unionist since then has , in the hope of improving the lot of his fellow workers , taken the theoretical Luddite hammer again . Hence the hostility to automation and the stop-watch manufacturing methods that have # led to restrictive practices . Now a new threat to those who toil and spin has been developed by a firm specialising in electronics in Los Angeles . They have developed a new system whereby completely untrained workers can be taught their trade by means of tape recordings and television . What happens is that the unskilled worker is processed , by high-speed listening to recorded instructions on how to do the job coupled with explanatory TV pictures , into becoming a highly skilled , obedient craftsman in no time at all . Not only can the raw human mind be technically equipped very quickly to do one set of skilled manufacturing processes in one trade but , by being given another of the new audio-TV training techniques , he can be switched to a different industry if he just gives in and From being an assembler in an aircraft factory to becoming a paint sprayer in a ceramic factory , he can be qualified for a completely new job in less time than it takes to say " Tolpuddle Martyrs ! " " CRICKET , " says the Oxford Dictionary , is " an open air game played with ball , bats and wickets between # two sides consisting of eleven players each . " Not so , dear Oxford Dictionary . You are out of date . Cricket in 1961 is played with a theodolite , six surveyors , a ball ; bats and wickets between two sides . Shades of the village stalwarts of Hambledon who are now the patron saints of the game ! What would THEY have thought of these civil engineers creeping about the pitch with their optical instruments ? The village green is the real home of cricket . A couple of bumps on a pitch have no terrors for a good batsman with a stout heart , a firm grip on the willow and a hefty contempt for batting averages and all the statistical blight that makes a mighty six these days as rare as frostbite in summer . They 'll be clapping the man who plays a straight theodolite next . EICHMANN continues # to reveal the extraordinary divisions of the German mind . Not content with arguing that he was only an efficient cog in the machine , he now claims that part of the endless massacre that led to the death of six million Jews was " decent , feasible and workable . " He feels satisfaction " from the fact that my personality had been tested and weighed and not found wanting . " He feels like Pontius Pilate who washed his hands before the multitude saying : " I am innocent of the blood of this just person . " Like Dr. Globke , whom I interviewed the other day , Eichmann said : " I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I could despite my low rank . " Eichmann is on dangerous ground when he pleads that he was only a small unit on the base of the triangle that led to Hitler , Himmler , Hess and Goering at the apex . In examination he betrayed an expert and intimate knowledge of every link in the chain of command that led to the top . He understood the whole apparatus with an exact and meticulous comprehension that could only have come from a man who used the system - and used it with power and authority . The appalling thing about the Germans is that they can kid them- selves and feel a sense of righteousness when their hands are red with blood . They really believed that the Treaty of Versailles was an iniquitous injustice . When they burst into Czechoslovakia , Poland , Holland , Belgium and France they really believed Hitler when he screamed at them that they were being " encircled . " They really believed in the moral superiority of " The New Order " which Himmler on October 4 , 1943 , expressed thus : " Whether nations live in prosperity or starve to death like cattle interests me only in so far as we need them as slaves to # our Kultur ; otherwise it is of no interest to me . This concept of slavery included Britain . General Brauchitsch signed a directive ordering that after the successful invasion of our islands all the " able-bodied male population between the ages of seventeen and forty-five will , unless the local situation calls for an exceptional ruling , be interned and dispatched to the Continent . " The Baltic States were to have been our destination . In no other conquered country , not even Poland , had the Germans begun with such a drastic step . There is no doubt that the compatriots of Eichmann would have been as good as their evil word . THE Inland Revenue people have a thankless task . But they do not make themselves less disliked by their attitude to their customers - who incidentally pay their salaries . Their demands are invariably couched in hectoring , out-of-date language , but in spite of all their bluster , they let many a big fish through the net while they are bullying the minnows . I have just heard a good example of their officious efficiency . A young chap I know got his first job last week . He is paid monthly in arrears and will not get a bean for the next twenty-one days . It was called " Abou Ben Adhem and the Angel . " I don't know why I was so impressed with this poem but , on re- flection , it might be that I took a guilty interest in the devilment busi- ness . I may well have felt that I was hell-bound under a strict Presbyterian upbringing and a possible reprieve might come through the sugary sentiments of " Abou Ben Adhem . " SOME 17 years ago , in the early summer of 1934 , the German ambassador in London was dictating a secret report to his chief von Papen , in Berlin . " Britain is uncomfortable in her role of champion of German rearmament , in opposition , to France . " Later that year he warned that Britain knew Germany was breaking the agreement to stop building bombers , and added : " Without Britain's tolerance German rearma- ment in the air would be jeopardised . " When Hoesch's reports , along with other nazi documents , were captured and published after the war the pattern of British Government connivance became clear . At nazi Germany's request , Britain was providing the cloak for Germany to build an air force bigger than that of France . Yesterday West German Defence Minister , Herr Strauss , started talks with the British Defence Minister , Mr. Watkinson . Their talks are another stage in the cloak operation , 1961 variety , by which the West German militarists are advancing their rearmament . Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October that his policy was to make his country the " strongest militarily in Europe and the United States' principal Nato ally . " His job is to build up the military apparatus which will back West Germany's economic domination of Western Europe through the Common Market . He continued this week the argument with Mr. Watkinson which he had in public at a Nato council meeting last year over the question : do we fight a 30-day war or a 90-day war ? A 90-day war , the West German view , provides the pretext for huge German armed forces ( within Nato of course ) and for those to have bases all over Western Europe . In the past year West Germany has secured agreements for " facilities " in France , Holland and Belgium . After much bargaining the British Government has agreed to give similar " facilities " The process has been too slow for Herr Strauss and last month he attacked Britain for being an obstacle for West Germany's plans for a " unified supply apparatus " in Nato . ( A supply apparatus which would link together the various West German " facilities . " ) By the end of the year there will be 11 German divisions in Nato compared with four divisions of British troops . Alongside these divisions a force of over 600 Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing up . These " fighters " are in fact fighter bombers which could launch an atomic attack on Eastern Europe . By 1963 the Germans plan to have nine missile battalions , with 288 missiles and 36 firing ramps , including weapons like Matador ( range 950 miles ) , also provided by the Americans . Last month West Germany was reported to be halfway toward this target . Her position as " America's principal Nato ally " grows stronger and stronger . Now this target which Herr Strauss and his fellows have their eyes on is control of the warheads to these weapons . General Heusinger , the man who caused a great disturbance last autumn All this has been achieved through Nato under American leadership . But a big role has been played not only by the British Government but by Right-Wing Labour in this country . They have helped build up Nato and rearm Western Germany , in pursuit of the old familiar anti-Soviet policy which brought disaster in 1939 . Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained and Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in control . Nato , far from being a means of controlling the German militarists , is , in fact , the cover for building up their power . What must Britain do ? Today , again , she has a key role . Let her tell men like Strauss that he shall have no bases or " facilities , " no help in his quest for atomic arms . A policy which breaks with military alliances like Nato and seeks friendship with the Soviet Union can prevent another betrayal like that of the '30s . Shipbuilding Draughtsmen , writing in his personal capa- city : * # I WAS pleased to read J. R. Camp- bell's article , for , as president of a union which fought for and still stands on the policy decisions established at the Scar- borough Labour Party Conference I am appalled at the character of the current For many years my union had to present its views to the two major conferences of the movement and take a licking . For us , unity meant accepting unpalatable majority decisions as binding on the movement and having a go next time . Alongside many others , we conducted our fight by putting down # unambiguous alternatives to official policy and seeking to win majorities for them . When Scarborough carried our point of view we were naturally delighted , more so because the alternatives had been put clearly to the movement , which had then chosen a vigorous anti-Nato , anti-Tory , anti-bomb and anti-German rearmament policy . Hopes rose as we saw a perspective of sharp struggle based on consistent lines of difference with the Tories . Many members understood that the bread-and-butter struggles of the union would become easier in the context For we have always felt , even if we have then by our practice ignored it , the inconsistency between support for the war alliance , with resulting colossal spending on armaments , and our basic effort to improve living standards . Instead , we saw the Gaitskellites using the position of organisational dominance established during their years They obstructed every effort to fight for the Scarborough decisions , while # scratching around frantically to overturn them next time . Confusion of the original issue by misrepresentation of the decisions , the introduction of a pseudo third way and the call for party unity - in effect , a demand that the movement unite with the Gaitskellites on their policy and no other seems to have done the trick of moving a number of unions It would become easy to become cynical and to despair . And yet , wherever the issues were put clearly , sections of the movement reaffirmed their original stand . Only where the issues were posed so as to cause doubt and confusion were positions lost . It is my view that this immediate confusion hides the fact that the Peace movement is still advancing and that clarification of the issues can bring a majority to # secure the Scarborough decisions . Powerful units have stood firm . In unions where the central issues were confused , clear policy details - as on bases - were decisively carried . This , and the numbers of active workers who are beginning to understand how and why the trick was done , provides a strong , immediate basis for a campaign against weak and doubtful positions , and for a consistent peace policy . All recent events show how correct the Scarborough decisions were . The Kennedy Administration's sharpened policies , the speeded-up drive to improve West Germany's armament , the new attempt to rush Britain into the European Common Market , and the kite-flying on Spain present a whole new proof that to abandon Scarborough is to expose Britain and her working class to sharp new dangers - that Gaitskellism is bankrupt . Ordinary working people will never rally to defend a policy founded on political chicanery or elect a Labour Government to carry through Tory policy - Gaitskell's stupid hope . The tragedy is that enormous inroads could already have been made into Tory strength by a fighting policy , based on Scarborough . THE desire for unity in the Labour and trade union movement following the At the same time that unity cannot be established on a false basis , or by creating further confusion within the movement . Unity will never be established on the basis of leaders being a law unto themselves and opposing conference decisions when it suits their own convenience . Unity can never be established by any formula uniting those who oppose German troops being trained on British soil and Polaris , and those who are for this policy - which is the same as that of the Tory Government . It is impossible for Labour's new Defence state- ment to unite the movement as the Labour leaders are not only in favour of American bases , but are in favour of German bases and troops being trained on British soil . The new Defence statement , while accepting that Britain can- not remain an independent nuclear Power , now supports the policy of depending on American nuclear weapons and the H-bomb , placing Britain in an even more dangerous position . The statement of Padley and Crossman is no different in principle to the new defence statement . They accept American nuclear bases , and also the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy until some future date . They deceive the people by their talk of political and collective control of Nato . The Pentagon has made it perfectly clear who controls the American H-bomb , and who will actually give the instructions to press the button for nuclear warfare . There is only one way to develop unity and at the same time defend Britain . This was shown at the Scottish Trades Union Congress , representing 800,000 organised trade unionists , when it decided by overwhelming votes , to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions on unilateral disarmament , and to oppose Polaris and military bases being installed on the Holy Loch , or any other part of Britain . Such a policy would unite the whole movement and lay the basis for the defeat of the present Tory Government , which has become a real menace to the British people both in home and foreign policy . It is quite evident that the movement will go on record against the Polaris base and facilities for German bases and military training . This should strengthen the campaign to end the manufacture and use of nuclear weapons in Britain . Britain then could play a leading and independent role for an international agreement to ban all nuclear strategy and weapons of mass destruction , and lay the basis for real peace and progress . WHEN all the ballyhoo about Commonwealth Training Week subsides it is doubtful whether more than a handful of new apprenticeships This week of window dressing will not prevent most of the hopeful 15-year-olds leaving school in six weeks time from ending up in blind alley jobs . It needs more than 10,000 church parades and open days at techs , more than descents into Brighton's sewers or balloon ascents over Wolverhampton for Britain's technical training to catch up with the space age . The heli-hopping Duke of Edinburgh , opening a few technical college extensions , will not keep us abreast of the scientific revolution . Out of the 550,000 young people aged 15-17 starting work in 1960 420000 ( 73 per cent ) went into unskilled work . The per- centage is expected to swell to 80 next year . The Duke , possibly speaking from experience , stated : But the Duke is wrong when he implies that young people prefer unskilled jobs . Countless numbers who want training are denied it . One area electricity board in 1958 offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450 applications , of whom 100 were considered suitable by the board . There were only 17 vacancies for the 58 boys who passed the Admiralty exams for Rosyth dockyard last year . The production by Bill Duncalf compressed a long and sometimes rambling story into a concentrated comprehensive survey of a life work . P. J. K. HANS WERNER HENZE'S " Elegy for Young Lovers " is the first unambiguously " contemporary " work to be admitted to the Glyndebourne canon . By no means a masterpiece , it is in many respects a representative modern work and the composer is a highly skilled manipulator of contemporary idioms , with a strong sense of words and situation . The libretto , by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman , is largely a satire on the petty court surrounding an ageing poet , whose deeply egocentric character leads him to sacrifice everything to his need of inspiration . Henze obtains his musical characterisation by means of individual instrumental timbres and " personal " intervals , and the result is often less delineation of character than caricature . This is also the chief , or at least the most successfully executed trait of the libretto , which contains an odd blend of highly The evil that Byron did certainly lived after him , and was even outmatched by the mischief perpetrated by almost every person who had been close to him . In turning over the bones Doris Langley Moore has brought to light a great deal of discreditable behaviour and a vision of mischief- making propensities of the leisured classes in the early 19th century which leaves one a little breathless . AFTER ten days of intermittent , near fatal ennui , the eleventh Berlin International Film Festival was suddenly jolted back to life by two extraordinary films , Bernhard Wicki's " Das Wunder des Malachias " ( " The Miracle of Father Malachias " ) and Michael- angelo Antonioni's " La Notte . " The num- ber of German film directors who have made first rate works in the last 25 years can be counted on the fingers of one It would now seem that Wicki's name must be added to this list , for his new film may well be a landmark in the revitali- sation of the German cinema . Wicki is not only a director . He began his career as an actor , had his first important film ro*?5le in Ka"utner's " Die letzt Bru"cke , " and he also appears in the new Antonioni film . In 1950 he began to take photographs not only in Germany but also in Africa and America . An exhibition of these works which is now on view in a Berlin gallery is most im- pressive . As Friedrich Du"rrenmatt , the Swiss playwright and author , wrote : " Wicki's blacks and greys are not only the colours of the lost and the forgotten , but they are also the technical means of abstraction . Every unnecessary detail , all superfluous local colouring must be eliminated . He does not want the accuracy of a police photograph , but rather he wants to show the eternal in every instant . " The chilling horror of " Mala- chias " is due as much to Wicki the photo- grapher as to Wicki the director . His earlier film , " Die Bru"cke , " was equally terrifying , but here the director moves out of the world of reality into an icy supernatural vacuum Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with considerable fidelity , the film tells the story of a little monk who prays that a disrepu- table night club near his church be re- moved . One night his prayer is answered and the offending establishment is suddenly transplanted to an island in the North Sea . But Father Malachias's troubles have only begun . Instead of having the desired effect , the miracle becomes exploited by a group Soon a carnival springs up on the sight of the missing building . The Church rebukes the poor monk for his miracle , and as a crowning indignity the night club is given a gala society reopening on the island . Father Malachias goes to the island , prays , and in a second miracle the night club is replaced in its original setting . A summary of the story can give almost indication of the scope of Wicki's artistry . He tells his story best in the faces of his crowds , recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat with brutal honesty , building up to a tremendous climax in the island orgy . Here , the guests arrive in ghost-like yachts , the wildly flapping white sails slashed by the glaring beacon of a lighthouse . When the final miracle does occur , it is accepted as a marvellous joke ; no one has learned anything . Wicki suddenly returns to the city for a final epilogue . In complete silence he shows the faces of people walking in the streets , smug , content , satisfied , and thoroughly frightening . Wicki has succeeded in his second film in recording his personal apocalypse of the last days of a sick society . It is most unfair to call " Malachias " a cut-rate " Dolce Vita , " for it is far more intimate and deeply felt . In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat in " Titanic " by paralleling the last days of the Third Reich with the sinking of the great ocean liner , and paid for his audacity with his life . Strangely enough , the Berlin audience received the film with extreme coolness , much preferring Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing " Une Femme est une Femme , " a ninety-one minute hymn to " Vogue , " " Cahiers du Cinema , " and the worst aspects of the American cinema . From a brilliantly funny start , the work fizzles out into a series of repetitious sight-gags and personal jokes incomprehensible to the uninitiated ( including four plugs for Charles Aznavour ) . This director is at last being re-evaluated and given his proper place in the history of the German film . Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek " Unheimliche Geschichten " ( 1920 ) , five ghost stories with a light touch , and there was much to admire in " Dreyfus " ( 1930 ) and the virtually unknown but extremely important " 1914 " ( 1931 ) , which tries to show that it took more than just Germany to start the First World War . Sentence Database C02-059 Prizes being what they are , Berlin is unusually generous in giving everyone something , and silver bears are awarded in every direction . Both the Antonioni and Wicki films took high honours , and the audience at the awards was particularly enthusiastic when one Miss Anna Kerima was selected as best actress for her work in the Godard film . Gifted with an interesting face , although little acting ability , she would seem to be well worth watching in the months to come . It has a great look of speed and technical fun about it , of enormous cinematic enjoyment , and above all of cinematic sense . Much of it has that air of improvisation , as of off-the-cuff living , that once seemed so new and so attractive . The story ( not that the story , in the sense of plot , matters much ; but in the sense of situation and movement it matters a lot ) is that of a man on the run ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ) , who spends a few days with an American girl Belmondo reappears at the Paris Pullman in Moderato Cantabile ( curiously trans- lated into Seven Days ... Seven Nights ... A certificate ) , Peter Brook's film made in France and shown last autumn at the London Film Festival . In spite of magnificent performances from him and from Jeanne Moreau , this has been fairly well trounced by the critics wherever it has appeared . Leisurely , even slow , With a large blond youth of quite dazzling dumbness called Troy Donahue ; and Claudette Colbert , still charming amid the nonsense , and Karl Malden not knowing how to take it , all rolling eyeballs like a villain from East Lynne .

NEXT month that friendly , effervescent performer Frankie Vaughan will burst on to the London Palladium stage in a new show . To paraphrase his well-known ditty : " He 'll have the limelight , they 'll give him the girls - and leave the rest to him . " I have a hunch that he will feel more at home in the old , star-studded West End than he will ever feel in Hollywood . His American bosses , 20th-Century Fox , have recently given Frankie the full , razzamataz , red-carpet treatment . But they haven't done a thing for his film career that Anna Neagle and Herbert Wilcox were not doing better here , before the platinum-plated Hollywood carrot was dangled before his nose . In his first Hollywood picture , " Let 's Make Love , " he was swamped by the know-how of Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand . Against this couple Frankie , in a cardboard role , didn't stand a chance . Now comes " The Right Approach " ( Rialto , " A " ) , and it 's a glum business . He plays an aspiring actor - a selfish , arrogant , brash , ambitious , unscrupulous heel - who would tread on anybody's neck to get a break in the Hollywood ratrace . He double-crosses the five pals with whom he lives , cheats a waitress ( Juliet Prowse ) and cynically uses a magazine editress ( Martha Hyer ) to get ahead . Frankie Vaughan is too nice a chap to ring quite true as a smooth-tongued , ill-mannered Yank . His best moments are when he swings breezily into the title song . But 6,000 miles seems a heck of a way to go for a new hit song . He might be well advised to think hard and long before his next jump into the Hollywood arena . VERDICT : Vaughan should have by-passed this approach . RONALD Lewis has just left for his first taste of the Hollywood treatment , thanks to a sound performance in " Taste of Fear " ( Warner Theatre , " X " ) . He has earned his break . The film is a well-made variation on that sinister yarn in which half the cast try to persuade the heroine that she is out of her mind . Despite flagrant cheating the eerie atmosphere is built up neatly . Susan Strasberg is the crippled damsel in distress . Stepmother Ann Todd and doctor Christopher Lee are also effectively around . They provide some chilly red herrings in this " Find-the-body " thriller . VERDICT : Don't believe all you see and hear ! NOT for the first time the homely mug of Sidney James has pumped life into a slim , strained comedy . He does his rescue act in " Double Bunk " ( Leicester-square Theatre , " A " ) . Navigator Sid is a tower of strength when newly-weds Ian Carmichael and Janette Scott let loose their ancient houseboat on a honeymoon trip down the river . The film starts off brightly enough but , half-way through , the plot ( as well as the boat ) springs a near-disastrous leak . Familiar members of Britain's repertory team of comedy character-actors jump through equally familiar hoops to mild laughter . VERDICT : The " bunk " needed doubling . DONALD HOUSTON had a big success on A T V's " Drama '61 " last night as a smooth , scheming jewel thief in a play by Jacques Gillies , " The Takers . " A polished production by Quentin Lawrence , here , held together by Mr. Houston's accomplished performance as the master mind behind a gang of crooks . This plot to rob a French millionaire of 300,000 worth of jewellery struck me as ingenious . The play had style , moved at a quick pace and everyone did well . But it was Mr. Houston's evening . Earlier , on the Palladium show I found Stanley Holloway's act too long and not particularly entertaining . It was also a mistake to re-book Gene Detroy and his performing chimpanzees so soon after their previous appearance . Their offering last night differed little from their earlier act on this show a week or so ago . But the Mudlarks , with Jeff Mudd out of the Army and back with sister Mary and brother Fred , were in bright , zestful form . Why only two numbers , though ? It was not enough . " A FAIR COP , " the B B C Whitehall farce last night , looked like a rabbit warren in a field of corn . I can't recall a production where so many comics bolted in and out of holes so often . The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead of his trousers . The action moved at tremendous speed , backed by some wonderful timing by the cast . I especially liked the tea-cup scene where six of the cast changed cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers . Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable . They alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut through the gormless standing corn around them . Perhaps it was accidental - I hope not . If ever a bag of humour needed a thorough shaking up the Whitehall farce is it when it comes to television . HOW do you get on records ? Well , you 've got to have something different . Sing slightly flat . All the good singers sing in tune . Twang a guitar slightly off key . Everybody 's fed up with the right way - so the best-seller charts say . Play an OLD 2pianna instead of a new one . You got to get it into your head , son ... people don't like things as they should be - not on record , anyway . Thus , musician David Lisbon's chances of being a starred disc solo pianist were greatly enhanced when he dug out A PACKET OF DRAWING-PINS . " Why not , " thought ex-soldier Mr. Lisbon , who is twenty-three , and lives in Dagenham , Essex , " press a thumb-tack into the nose of the hammers that strike the piano strings ? " He did , on his piano at home . There weren't enough tacks and he got only the middle hammers done . Then he tried it out for sound . Um-chink ... um-chink ... it went . Slightly flat and jangly in part . DELIGHTFUL ! He put the sound on tape . The tape went to the Philips company . Within two days Mr. Lisbon had a record contract . And they hauled his thumb-tacked joanna the thirteen miles to London for his first session . Now along comes his solo disc , featuring two of his own compositions , " Deerstalker " and " Almost Grown Up . " VERDICT : Mr. Lisbon has it taped . And tacked . And he says : " Just as well I had only one box of tacks - it might have been so different ... . " More news from the ivory-thumping dept. ... Russ Conway , who has tinkled his way to fame on an old 2pianna , comes in with another of his own works : " Parade of the Poppets " ( Columbia ) . But not one of his nimble-fingered best . GERMANY'S Russ Conway is a pianist who calls himself CRAZY OTTO . But nothing crazy about his pianistics . He pounds merrily away at a piece called " Piccadilly " ( Polydor ) . I find it cute . American pianist Floyd Cramer , who played for Elvis on " It 's Now or Never , " looks like having a success on his own with " On the Rebound " ( RCA ) . NEW boy on the vocal front is Rolly Daniels , who comes 5,000 miles from India to seek disc fame . Comedian Hal Monty saw him in Bombay , became his manager . And such is Hal's faith that he brings him to Europe . Now Rolly gets his big break - a record , the modern Aladdin's lamp of show business . Become a success with a disc and hey presto ! You 're a star ... . Rolly sings with assuredness " Bella Bella Marie " ( Parlophone ) , a lively song that changes tempo mid-way . I don't think he will storm the charts with this one , but it 's a good start . CHRIS CHARLES , 39 , who lives in Stockton-on-Tees , is an accountant . He is also a director of a couple of garages . And he finds time as well to be a lyric writer . He writes with Tolchard Evans , composer of " Lady of Spain " and other big hits . Tolch , as he is known in Tin Pan Alley , likes songs with a month in the title . He wrote " My September Love , " the big David Whitfield hit of 1956 . " Let 's have another song with a month in it , " said Tolch . Mr. Charles obliged with " April Serenade . " This week it appears , a tuneful melody sung impeccably by Robert Earl ( Philips ) . PRODUCER Russell Turner , 33 , provides his last programme for the B B C tonight with Robert Harbin's " Mystery and Magic " ( 7.30 ) . After six years with the Corporation , during which he started " Juke Box Jury " and directed " Six-Five Special , " Turner is aiming to go into free-lance T V , film and stage production work . " I feel I 've done all I can at the B B C , " he told me . " We mutually agreed to part . " Escapologist Dill-Russell is a guest in Harbin's show tonight . Boxing fans can see an eight-round feather-weight contest between Chris Elliot and Harry Carroll from Leicester ( B B C , 8.25 ) . A SONGS-OF-BRITAIN medley is sung by David Hughes in his " Make Mine Music " ( B B C , 9.30 p.m. ) . The numbers include " Scotland the Brave , " " Men of Harlech , " " McNamara's Band , " " Greensleeves " and " English Rose . " Fay Compton stars in " No Hiding Place " ( I T V , 9.35 p.m. ) . She plays the possessive mother of a man whose hobby revolves round a doll's house . THREE people will be hypnotised in tonight's " Lifeline " ( B B C , 10.15 ) . They will be asked to comment on the design of everyday articles such as a chair and a motor-car . The idea is to see what happens when parts of the mind not normally available without hypnosis are used . I T V have postponed Malcolm Muggeridge's " Appointment with playwright Arnold Wesker . " Instead , Muggeridge's appointment will be with Sir Roy Welensky the Premier of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland ( 10.30 p.m. ) . Say Granada T V , the producers : " We decided to make the switch because of the topicality of African affairs . The Wesker interview will be seen at a later date . " ACTOR Tom Courtenay was an outstanding success last night in I T V's " Private Potter , " his first big T V part . The play was a brilliantly-written essay on soldiering which stated that a fighting man could only be regarded as a machine . Potter screamed during an action , and was arrested . He claimed he had seen a vision of God - only the padre and his C O believed him . Courtenay played the part with a gawky , Northern defiance . The cameras played continuously on his craggy face , and obstinate , baffled eyes . They stripped him of his ugly battle-dress , to leave him for what he was - Potter , a frightened boy who had a vision . It was a splendid interpretation of the part . The rest of the cast were well chosen , with James Maxwell making a fine job of the sympathetic C O . Paul Daneman gave another first-class performance last night as a wartime naval officer in the B B C's " The Little Key . " The play was no more than a figment of the imagination which asked the viewer to believe in a beautiful ghost . It would have been an impossible piece of television but for clever production by Michael Hayes . He captured the atmosphere of fog and mystery to great effect . MORE than 100 viewers complained to the B B C last night that an American film , " Britain - Blood , Sweat , and Tears ... Plus Twenty Years , " was anti-British . The film replaced " What 's My Line ? " and " Be My Guest " programmes because of an electricians' strike . It showed Britain today through the eyes of an American T V reporter , Eric Sevareid , and British personalities . Among them - Professor Dennis Brogan , Shelagh Delaney , and Alan Sillitoe . The film covered a wide aspect of the British scene , ranging from pubs , the Eton wall game , to the European Common Market . Shelagh Delaney and Alan Sillitoe attacked education . It was left to reporter Sevareid to make the strongest criticisms . He said that in the race of the modern nations , Britain was slipping behind ... . IT is mid-morning on a Dublin Sunday . The streets are tranquilly sunny and still , for the town is at Mass . Most of it . In the front room of a house in Anglesey-road is a congregation who never actually got to church , but who are gathered with devotion around Brendan Behan and a brandy bottle . Where the 2bhoys are . In the hallway are the empties ; through the door hearts are full , hopes are high . There are still a few amber inches in the bottle . Present are some hard-core Friends of Brendan . They listen with many an obliging guffaw to the brandy owner's solo swish on his anecdotal roller-coaster , with occasional stops for an old I.R.A. air or a Connemara tear-jerker . ALSO present is a London journalist who arrived two hours earlier by appointment to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and The Hostage about his new work , if any , and who is now being pluckily convivial to fight off the frustration . The telephone has rung a couple of times , calls from other chums sniffing the wind and offering to drop by for a chat . At last Brendan - to the journalist's relief - turns his attention to the writing scene . He proceeds to place himself in the literary hierarchy . " I consider myself , " he says , " a cut above Evelyn Waugh socially , a cut above Nancy Mitford artistically , a cut above Frank Haxell conversationally . " But , " he continues , " the greatest is Shelagh Delaney . Just because A Taste That 's as bloody silly as calling a Rolls- Royce a type of transport . She 's the flower in a cultural desert . " Now , me - I 'm a journalist , I write to entertain rather than educate . And I don't write at all unless I 'm exceedingly 2skint . " But I 'll say this . I 'd like to live in America and do some writing there . It 's a very free place to write in , and there 's the advantage that no one knows what you 're writing about anyway . " Not that I did much when I was over this past two times , not with that great little Irish bar on Seventh Avenue , The Pigsty , always open . I was there , in even faster orbit , when that third astronaut went up - what 's his name ? I 'm the only man on earth who doesn't know what his name is . Don't tell me . I want to preserve that distinction . " I already know about Shepard and that Salvation Army chap Gagarin - the two biggest bores since Cardinal Newman . That 's enough of all that hooey . " HE plunges on into reminiscences of his trips . There is much to recall . Among other incidents he was banned from New York's St. Patrick's Day parade as a " disorderly person . " He was in a fight after telling a Canadian , during a chat about space-flight : " Ireland will put a shillelagh into orbit , Israel will put a matzo ball into orbit , and Lichtenstein will put a postage stamp into orbit before you Canadians put up a mouse . " And he suffered an alcoholic seizure and was gravely ill in hospital with a diabetic and heart condition . His return to Dublin was heralded by the announcement that he was " off the gargle - a retired alcoholic . " Since then he has been heard of often in the newspapers - three times up before the beaks for drunk and disorderly conduct . LESS has been heard of Brendan's work . It is now five years since his first play , The Quare Fellow , was produced , three years since Borstal Boy was published and The Hostage was put on . What has happened to the play , Richard's Cork Leg , begun 18 months ago and due for presentation at the Theatre Royal , Stratford , last spring ? It was never finished . What happened to the new book partially tape-recorded by his publishers in March of last year ? Still a skeleton . Yet I have before me now a 12,000-word manuscript of a book planned to be called Confessions of an Irish Rebel which was delivered to his agents in June . IT begins : " There was a party to celebrate Deirdre's return from her abortion in Bristol . " It is ribald , funny , brilliantly observant of character , and authentic as a glass of draught porter . But will we see its end ? The last scene of this fragment is in a pub where the author throws a 10 note on to the bar and orders a round for the pals , one of whom cries : I AM happy to report that I saw some- thing this week I have never before witnessed , either in pictures or outside - a budgerigar playing a drunk scene , and playing it with perfect timing and technique . It gives one loud , clear hiccup and falls flat on its back . This brilliant budge , I may add , gets no credit in the cast list of Come September ( Odeon , Leicester-square ) , which suggests that it is either using a stand-in for the stunt The performance of our talented feathered friend is not the only good thing ( although the one original touch ) in the film , which is better- than-average glossy comedy , Hollywood- styled , European set . Most of it has been shot in and around the sun-terrace of the Hotel Splendido ( renamed the Dolce Vista for the picture ) in Portofino - and if there 's a better view It also parades Gina Lollobrigida in a selection of neglige*? 2e-and-nightie ensembles not too well designed for sleeping in , and Rock Hudson at the wheel of a shining silver Rolls-Royce . Mr. Hudson is an American millionaire who spends each September in his Italian villa and the company of Signorina Lollobrigida . In the holiday seasonal months before and after this annual idyll his major-domo ( Walter Slezak at his most nauseating ) turns the palazzo into a luxury hotel . # Inevitably there comes the time when Mr. Hudson suddenly breaks with tradition and arrives there in July , when , just as inevitably , the place is full of American teenagers on an escorted tour . Result : Mr. Hudson and lady love Lollo find themselves playing chaperon ( Brenda de Banzie , the official one , has broken a leg ) to the girls , who have just been joined by a Jeep-load of boys . It 's hereabouts that the budge takes to the bottle , but I don't think it was through boredom . The film is funny enough in places and has a line or two of painful home truths thrown in . " I don't want to talk like an adult , " screams Gina , walking out on the man who has so far failed to make an honest woman of her . " That 's how I got into all this trouble . " " He 's got to be 35 , " says Bobby Darin , the chief spokesman of the jeans-and- Jeep brigadiers as they 're scheming to get rid of old man , solid Rock . " How many hills can he take ? " Of course Mr. Hudson can take one more hill than the youngsters . So all ends as you know it will , with the middle-aged romancers respectably wed and Master Darin going steady with the delectable Sandra Dee ( to whom , I believe , he is married in real life ) . Miss Dee , incidentally , who keeps turning up as the typical teenager in all the " good girl " parts ( Tuesday Weld gets the " bad girl " ones ) , is becoming quite an accomplished actress . THE Marriage-Go-Round ( Carlton ) is also a comedy of manners , but fun-films toting an X certificate have to keep a sharp look-out that the jokes about sex ( what else would they joke about with an X ? ) are of the witty , verbal variety and not the visual slapstick . This has only one gag - that of the entry of a gladiator The girl is a knock-out ( see pic- ture of Julie Newmar for con- firmation ) . She also has quite a mission in mind . She , " younger , prettier , stronger , and more intelligent " than the wife ( as she soon tells her ) , wants to have the perfect baby . And she has chosen the husband ( James Mason ) , who is an academic friend of her Nobel prize-winning father to be This sort of situation calls for some subtle , slightly sardonic handling . It doesn't get it . But The Marriage-Go-Round is not entirely a waste of time . I learned from it that in the Institutes of Advanced Studies attached to some American universities the subject Social Psychology used to be called Home-making and is now known as Domestic Relations . Susan Hayward plays the wife sharply and sweetly . Mason is always good for a glower . And Miss Newmar is a stunner in every sense of the word . According to the script she was once captain of the junior hockey team at her school . So help me so was I . IL GRIDO ( The Cry ) - Paris Pullman - is an earlier essay in atmospheric meandering by the L'Avventura man , Michelangelo Antonioni . ON a March evening in 1932 in the New Jersey family household the nursemaid tiptoed into the baby's room to see that 20-month-old Charles Jun. was sleeping . Bending over the cot , she suddenly realised that there was no sound of breathing . She thrust out her hand - and felt emptiness . A FEW minutes later the father gripping a loaded rifle , told his wife : The plain , sober manner of its style all the more tellingly points up not only the horror of the case itself , which floundered on to the electrocution four years later of a German- born Bronx carpenter named Bruno Richard Hauptmann , but to the raree-show emotionalism and sensation-hunger of that era . The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote . The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel . There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations . The present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history . The original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was accidentally damaged . An editor , who was not the author , made what he could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order . Most of those who expound a theory of textual dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was written entirely by one author before the disturbance took place but a few leave it open to suppose that the original book had been revised even before the upheaval . The ingenuity of the theories is impressive and is the best argument against them . Thomas Spreng The one real weakness of the Commentator's case is that , in common with all his colleagues , he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly how this enlargement was effected nor has he been able to explain the textual movements by showing that such changes are part of a simple and coherent plan . To understand how this is possible it is necessary to examine the text of the Gospel . THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly written in Greek . A modern text of the Gospel represents the work of generations of scholars who have compared the many manu- scripts of John and worked out the version which is most likely to have been the original wording . It is not possible to establish any one text with absolute precision . The most convenient one for the authors has been the text of A. Souter . In this version of the text the Fourth Gospel is printed as just over 1,000 different nouns , verbs , and other parts of speech occurring 15,695 times in their different grammatical forms . There are other texts which could have been used , and ( as shown in Table 1 ) it is not a matter of the greatest importance which text is used . At first sight the difference between Souter and the other texts is rather large . But the British text includes the paragraph 7.53-8.11 , the Woman taken in Adultery , and this accounts for 178 words out of 279 , which is the difference between the 15,695 words of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's . The omission or inclusion of this paragraph is a matter of editorial decision rather The bar was the commonest marking , but others were also used . Dots sometimes served in place of the bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as it is now used to mark a paragraph ending . Frequently paragraphos markings were omitted . C. H. Roberts is of the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel some markings would be used , although which , it is impossible to say . Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that the original of the Gospel would be unmarked . The original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex , whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in columns . This is the invariable practice of ancient manuscripts . A common size of column would hold about one third of a page of Souter's print . The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel and the sheet wound round this central pin . The roll made a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not an easy form of book in which to find a reference . This last objection might have had some weight in ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 , the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making . As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his information is contemporaneous with the New Testament . The other form of book was the codex . In this the sheets were bound together down one edge much as they are in modern books . Against these advantages the codex was fragile and might be bulky . It is sometimes possible to tell whether or not a particular text was written on a roll or a codex . Rolls were prepared for writing , but any papyrus left unused at the end could be cut off . If the text was longer than the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on . The verso of the roll was blank , and one cannot think of an author , Mark for example , sending out his Gospel lacking the ending , while one whole side of his roll was unused . The codex form was not so accommodating . Even in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra sheet glued on might have to be gummed on over the binding , or the whole codex rebound . Close to the building projects would be the VINEYARDS ( 1 Kings 4.25 ; S. of Sol. 8.11 ) . The word is a Persian loan-word , pairi-deaza , from which our word paradise is derived . Qoheleth has a second paradise at his disposal but he is no happier than Adam was ! The word is used in the singular in Neh. 2.8 and S. of Sol. 4.13 . A natural transition from gardens and orchards to the vital question of water supply . The pools are probably natural springs enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in the rock . King Mesha of Moab boasts of their construction in lines 9 , 23-25 of the Moabite Stone , which read : And I built Baal-meon and made in it the reservoir ... and I made both the reservoirs for water inside the town . According to the legend , Solomon had asked the Prince of the Demons , " Ashmodeus " to bring him the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the Shamir had not been placed under his charge , as there is no Shamir in Gehenna ( Hell ) . An eagle brought the Shamir to Solomon from Eden , the Paradise , the only place where the Shamir could be found . The Talmud describes that the Shamir lives in a sanctuary , and only some rare birds know the existence of it . These birds are , the Cherubim and the Seraphim . We are also told that the Shamir is the stylus used by Moses , and this stylus is described as a very precious diamond-stone and very adamant . The word Shamir was used as a personal name ( Git. 68a ) . The Hebrew word " SHAMIR " means guarded or preser- ved . Therefore , the real man , who regards himself as insignificant , as the prayer says : " What am I ? A worm " , he is the Shamir and such a man fulfils the Shmah , loves the Lord God with all his heart , and with all his soul and with all his might and studies the word of God . This man is the worm , the creature that cuts and polishes Altar-Stones . Such a man is the Shamir that guards him- self against all the irrelevant pleasures . Such a Shamir possesses the real acid to mould our character , to melt our heart of stone . This Shamir helps us earthly creatures to build an Altar for God to come nearer to God . The action of the Shamir writes books and their books are readable . This Shamir is indeed a rare diamond that incises the hardest rock , the hardest facts . And these creatures existed from the beginning . It is " the stone , which the builders refused , but it is to become the head-stone of the corner " . ( Ps. 118 , 22 . ) And the stone shall tell ! " For the stone shall cry out of the wall " , like Baalam's ass , " and the purlin of timber shall creak in answer " " if the roof of our security is crushing our soul " ( see Hab. 2 , 10-11 ) . And it is through the Shamir : " That the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Glory of the Lord , as the waters cover the sea . " ( Hab. 2 , 14 . ) The Shamir's daily life writes the Decalogue , which is written on two plates , the hard facts of life , and all facts are " one " . We have all come across human Shamirs and they leave a deep impression on our feelings and senses . They make us the Altar for God to emit the Light which can be read in every language . The Shamir is the " seventh " and most important creature , that was created on the eve of the Sabbath , to bring the Sabbath , real peace to the whole world . Then the whole earth will be His Altar . " And it shall come to pass , if 1ye shall 1hearken diligently unto my commandments , which I command you this day , to love the Lord your God , and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul . " This may seem very good , but there is something deficient . Under such conditions without putting your mind together we cannot solve the further summons of destiny , to solve the economic problems . Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai ( Tanis 6a ) " if Israel does not fulfil the wish of the Lord , failing to serve the Lord God with all their visionary power , the work will have to be done by each individual " . They will not work in union . If physical power , spiritual power and visionary power is not united , man will remain in his heart selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to gratify selfish aims , then each man will gather-in for himself only , instead of all to help to gather your corn , your wine and your oil . Freedom from want cannot be fulfilled nor freedom from fear , fear of starvation in the midst of plenty . Help will not be easily forth- coming for the people in need . They will think of the animals first ( which is of course our duty ) . Of course the individual will eat and be full but : " Take heed to yourself , that your heart be not deceived , and 1ye turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them " , the yourself is thy greatest enemy , the self- seeking self . And you serve Mammon and God . And you cannot serve two masters , and you worship self-interest , isolating yourself , under such conditions the goods are your gods . " And then the Lord's wrath be kindled against you , and he shut up the heavens , that there is no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit and lest 1ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord 1giveth you . " For without the vision to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might the problem of life cannot be solved . " Therefore shall 1ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul . " The text adds and in your soul , searching your soul . And the sequence in the text is different than in the first part of the Shmah , we have first " and to bind them for a sign upon your hand , that they may be as frontlets between your eyes . " First to bind them to have the vision and then " And 1ye shall teach them to your children . " And as we have go- ne through the mill , we need not teach them to the children any more diligently and the children will grasp now what will befall them without visionary power . And we will nail the Divine Law on the door posts of the house and upon the gates . " That your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land , which the Lord swear unto your father to give them , as days of HEAVEN ON EARTH " That means the Kingdom of Messianic Righteousness ( Talmud Sanh. 99A ) . The Messusah , which is nailed on the doorposts contains those two lessons . The third lesson of the Shmah ( Numbers 15 , 37-41 ) is called " the going-out of the land of Egypt " . It starts with the story of the fringes the " tsitsits " . This lesson used to be read only in the morning . And the Talmud tells a story , which is also in the Hagadah that Rabbi Eleasar ben Assarja said , " I am nearly seventy and I had not succeeded that Ben Zoma said : " The days of 1thy life means in the day-time ; all the days of 1thy life means even at night-time . " ( Berochoth . ) And the Rabbis thought it important that when we read the Shmah " to be willing to hear , " we should remember the Great Deliverance : Passover and its connection with the fringes ( the tsitsits ) . And the tsitsits had a message sealed inside the knots just as there is a message sealed in the four emblems which are used on Passover , to depict the " time of our freedom " . And they are ( 1 ) Matzo ; ( 2 ) Bitter Herbs ; ( 3 ) Salt-water and Charauses ( a kind of fruit mixture in likeness of the appearance of mortar ) ; and ( 4 ) an attitude to lean back . ( 1 ) Matzos is deficient bread , ( LECHEM ANJO in Hebrew ) , so are we deficient without spiritual knowledge , and to cure our mental incapacity we should be willing to learn . Education is always the most important task . Education gives : Freedom of Speech . ( 2 ) Bitter Herbs symbolises the bitterness that is hurled against us . We eat it . We accept it , to show we have self-control and that God dwells within us . Self-control gives us : Freedom to worship God . ( 3 ) Salt Water and Charauses : the salt-water at the Seder-Table represents the Covenant of the Torah ( MELACH BRITH ELOHECHO in Hebrew , Salt is the covenant of 1thy God , Levit. 2 , 13 . ) Salt preserves and we should have this salt in ourselves and have peace with one-another . And the sweet Mortar ( the CHARAUSES in Hebrew ) that binds all the " hard- facts " together and explains them , represents the Oral Tradition . We dip into both , at the Seder . And we want to understand more of the Torah and the Oral Tradition , our inheritance . Living the life of the Torah ( " dipping-in " ) makes us meek : " But the meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of Peace " ( Psalm 37 , 11 ) . That gives us freedom from want . ( 1 ) Matzo represents Peshat ; ( 2 ) Moraur represents Remez ; ( 3 ) Dipping-in represents Derush ; ( 4 ) Leaning-back represents Saud . ( This is the PARDUS . ) Matzo represents the literal meaning of Pesach which is called : The Feast of Matzos . The Bitter-Herbs represent the spiritual principle and this gives us " a wink " ( Remez ) how to live and accept all the bitterness that is hurled against us . The Salt-water and the sweet Mortar in which we dip-in represents the richness of the Law and that we should Leaning back carries the concealed message . And we start the Seder showing the Matzos , that they rep- resent the " Bread of Poverty " which our fore-fathers were eating in Mitzrajim , to show they were willing to learn ; and we invite anybody who wishes to partake in our discussions , saying : " Anybody who is hungry , let him come and eat , Anybody who is thirsty , let him come and drink . " And we want all to eat and drink His Great Philosophy of the four ways of Israel's redemption . Hence " four questions " , which are really interrogations to examine into the principles of the four re- demptions are asked at the Seder-evening about these " four symbols " ( the MANISHTANO ) . And the person who asks these questions is seeking the opinion of the one who is conducting the Seder . And we answer , that the Lord our God gave us " four freedoms " without which Society cannot make progress . And we drink " four cups " to thank the Lord our God for the " four freedoms " which are Divine . There are four ways of redemption : ( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the burdens of Egypt . ( 2 ) I will rid you of their bondage . ( 3 ) I will redeem you . ( 4 ) I will take you to me for a people . ( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the burdens of Egypt : How was it that Israel was brought out from under the burdens of Egypt ? Because , they kept the Passover and they were eating Matzos in Egypt and the " Feast of Matzos " was known even to Abraham and Lot . The new century opened with James 1 ascending the throne . He was quite prepared to be tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot spoiled that . The Puritans had high hopes , for James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland , but those hopes were dashed . True , a new Prayer Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans derived little comfort from it . They objected to the word Absolution . So the phrase ' or the remission of sins ' was added . But Absolution remained . They objected to the word Confirmation . So the phrase ' or the laying on of hands upon children baptized and able to render an account of their faith according to the Catechism following ' were added . But Confirmation remained . Other changes in the Book were equally minor except for the new section on the Sacraments added to the Catechism . This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had been the mood which produced the Black Rubric , for it says that ' the Body and Blood of Christ , which are verily and indeed taken and received by the faithful in the Lord's Supper . ' It could hardly be more definite . It was at this time , too , that King James made himself immortal by becoming associated with a Bible translation - the Authorized Version ( which was never actually authorized ! ) . In that year Shakespeare had just turned forty and had written Hamlet two years before . Bacon was at work and Milton was just learning to read . James was followed by Charles , in whose reign came the Scottish Prayer Book in 1637 . Significantly this made a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and became the foster mother of some of the most important Prayer Books in the Anglican Communion . Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud , now so much nobler a figure than former historians led us to believe . Laud was enthusiastically hated by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was mutual . But Laud was no Romanizer . One of his first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with the Jesuit , Fisher . But anyone who was friendly with James and Charles , the Puritans argued , was necessarily a menace . Or when he found cock-fighting going on in church ? Laud made a positive approach . He set out to increase a sense of reverence . The Prayer Book was to be respected and so was the office of a bishop . Altars should be altars and not any broken down , transportable table which was handy for the most improbable uses . In the first place it is not a great deal of use telling even children , as I have already suggested , not to be silly or to pull themselves together . Far better to help them to face whatever it is that is worrying them , to find the original cause and then deal with it ; show it up either for the sham it is - and many fears are based upon completely irrational pre-conceived notions - or to Even worse is to laugh . Tremendous damage may be done to a child by laughing at what are very real fears . As adults , we know that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable , but to a child they are very real . Not that I am suggesting that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the other side as victors . To ridicule them only pushes them farther into themselves , so that they become unable to speak about it to anybody and the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown , the harvest of which may still be being reaped at forty or fifty . Far better to agree with a child that a particular situation is frightening , and then to face it together until the child can see how unnecessary its fears were . Because situations which may contain all the elements of fear can arise suddenly , it is a good idea to condition a child to some extent against it . To keep a child of twelve or thirteen under the impression that nothing nasty ever happens is not merely dishonest , it is unwise . As I shall suggest in a later chapter there are some situations which occur less frequently than A little more honesty , even if one refrains from going into too many details , would help many a child to make a proper adjustment to life as it grows up . Let us look at Jesus . We do not , I think , see there a life without fear . There are several instances where he seemed unable to go on . In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup should pass from Him . Jesus shows us the way to face life . To see all the latent frightening possibilities and yet by facing them and knowing God is with us and that , with Him , there is nothing that can finally defeat us . More than that , that God has something important to do with our lives and that the nearer we get to Him , the stronger we become . ... Today A wonderful thought In the dawn was given ... And the thought Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in my hand ; That my hand is big Big , Because of the plan That God , Who dwells in my hand , Knows this secret plan , Of the things He will do for the world Using my hand . Toyohiko Kagawa . Loving Saviour , who experienced all human emotion , and whose sensitive nature knows better than we do , what it is to be really afraid , help us to know that when we face life boldly , many of the shadows are seen to be allies and not enemies and that , come what may , we are never alone when we are with Thee . Amen . MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a purely physical thing . The cure for which is sleep . This is only partly true . Many people wake up tired of a morning and no amount of rest seems to make any difference . Sleep , to be effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes from innocence . To others , the long hours of the night bring only a disturbed tossing and turning which causes them to wake feeling worse than when they went to bed . We may begin to understand this a little better when we realize that tiredness itself is largely in the mind . Very few people , under normal conditions , work themselves to a standstill . The mind tires first and conveys the impression of tiredness to the body . This can be proved by noting the effect of a new stimulus on some- body who feels thoroughly tired . Suppose a mother has news late at night that her child is in danger . She will undertake a journey which , an hour before , she would have declared impossible . Even more simply , test your own reactions to different situations . There are some which bring on an almost immediate feeling of tiredness - such as when your wife mentions the washing-up - while others , if they refer to something you like doing , bring a veritable surge of energy . Many a girl who is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump up with no apparent tiredness at all when her boy friend calls and go for a long walk . Nor is she necessarily being deceitful . She really did feel tired until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an attractive - interest ! Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion . A disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense of fatigue . They wonder why they get no rest at night , even if they do sleep . They drag themselves around and can become a burden to their families and their friends . Any mental confusion can cause this and the best way is probably to seek advice . As we are unable to cure our own bodies if the cause of our pain is too deep seated , so we are unable to cure our own minds , if the trouble is a complicated one involving careful and patient treatment . One of the greatest steps forward that has been made this century is the way in which illness of the mind is no longer feared or shunned , and is in fact no differently regarded than physical illness . There is , nevertheless , a great deal of tiredness which comes from no major complication but results from an inability to deal with life , especially under the diverse pattern which is the twentieth century . In the days when most people were born , lived and died within the boundaries of the village , it was not difficult for anybody to live a day at a time . Even those who held a high and responsible office lived in far greater simplicity than their successors . When news from the Continent took days , from America weeks , from the Far East , months , even a Prime Minister could go to sleep in blissful ignorance of what might be happening at the other end of England , In other ways , too , life for the ordinary individual has become so complex that it taxes the mind . Two hundred years ago , men lived and worked in one place , their lives were of one piece . Now a man may live twenty , thirty even sixty miles from his work . The only connexion is the pipeline of the railway on which they travel day by day . In many cases , their homes know little of their place of work and their associates at the office or works wonder what they are possibly like in the surroundings of their homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead a ' double ' life without ever deliberately planning to do so or in fact being conscious of what is going on . It is easier to live life in compartments but over the years it builds up , and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which need to be handled correctly . Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life as fully as possible , without having our energy sapped by un- necessary weariness . ( a ) Order makes for a decrease in tiredness . We have a saying ' My head will never save my feet ' . Time after time we forget something and have to go back upstairs or down to the shops . If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time - we lose this way in the course of a day we would be staggered . Some of it is inevitable , and we do not want to become too pernickety . Nevertheless , we could all probably be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle through . The housewife would find life far less tiring if she made a list , followed a routine of work rather than getting from one thing to the next . The business man would find that he reached the end of the day with far less strain if he was a little more systematic . To drift aimlessly along is more wearying than any- thing else . If we would only sit down and write out all the necessary jobs waiting to be done and then work quietly through them , we would find life considerably less exhausting There may be some who will argue that routine destroys the soul . It is so easy , they say , to get into a rut . Save us from the school curriculum and even worse the school system whereby for meals everybody knows beforehand exactly what , on any given day of the week , they are going to have . If - such a critic may say - you are calling us to adventure , do not strangle us before we start by putting us into a strait-jacket I am more than conscious of this . How anybody can go through the same routine day in and day out for forty years I find difficult to understand . A lot of it is inevitable so that industry and commerce may be kept going - though if ever it becomes possible to work out a system of ' staggered ' hours it may do an immense amount of good over and above relieving the pressure on over-crowded trains . As it is , with so much of our life already in a predetermined groove , I would hardly like to add further to the dullness which it engenders . But I am not arguing for this . I know how much of a drag it can be and I was interested some little while ago to hear of a school who tried a six- day timetable . They only worked , of course , a five- day week so that in the first week Monday to Friday were days one to five of the timetable , the following Monday was day six and Tuesday started day one again and so on . By this means they avoided each week being the same with a pupil knowing exactly what the subject would be on Friday afternoon at 3 p.m. . It was a little complicated to work , of course , and there had to be a big notice in the entrance saying which day of the timetable it was - but it added immensely to the interest and kept everybody on their toes . To have order does not mean getting into a dull routine . I have great sympathy with the young wife who does not always want to do the washing on a Monday . I would not want to either , but if she wants to get through the day without becoming exhausted , she will be well advised to sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to do , note the order in which they can most conveniently be done ( or must be done because of other predetermined factors - you must , for example , do your shopping on the morning of the early closing day ) . She will , in fact , be surprised at what peace of mind ensues . ( b ) Concentrate on one thing at a time . A list or a plan enables us to put all our energies into the particular matter on hand . ( Actually , the Mishnah quotes two further proof texts and the Gemara explains why these , too , are necessary , but a careful examination of that passage makes it clear that these are not quoted here because they are not necessary to prove the point made by R. Joshua b. Levi . ) Finally , we note that the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted elsewhere . From the above it follows that here , once again , we have a good illustration of how a sugya has been fashioned from material already in the hands of the Redactors . The sugya is built around the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi . The proof text for the reading of the Book of Esther is quoted with the comment given by Samuel . ( This is probably to be understood as a well- known comment on the verse ; quoted by Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b. Levi's thesis ! ) The proof text of greeting by the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah . There is no reference to the Mishnah here because the Mishnah deals with the actual practice of greeting by the divine Name and the Gemara here quotes the texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi . The question and answer with regard to the need for the text of the angel are quoted here in the same words in which they are quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah . This can either mean that both sugyas are quoting a well-known question and answer or that our sugya is quoting from the longer sugya which deals with all four texts quoted in the Mishnah . Or it is possible that our sugya contains the original question and answer and this is quoted in the other sugya . ( This can be supported by the use of the expression : ' Boaz did it of his own accord but there was no approval of his action in Heaven ' in both sugyoth . Such an expression appears to have been framed in response to the particular point at issue here , whether the Heavenly Court concurred in the decision of the human court . ) The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple is then quoted and the interpretation of the latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh is added , not because this is at all relevant to the discussion but because it was a familiar interpretation which had become so well known that it was invariably quoted whenever the verse itself was quoted , almost as if it were a part of the verse . The Gemara continues with a saying of the Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) : ' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places : the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah , and the court of Solomon . ' The place of this saying here is obvious , it follows naturally on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which deals with a similar theme . We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys that he was a great man for lace - paying as much as 3 for a lace collar . But this didn't mean he was prepared to do as much for his lady , for he records testily : ' My wife and I fell out about my not being willing to have her gown laced . ' We read , with sympathy , an advertisement in the reign of Charles 2 stating : ' Lost : a lawn 1hand- kercher with a broad hem laced round with fine Point lace about four fingers broad ' and among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an unpaid bill for ' scarlet satin shoes with silver lace ' . The records of these tender trifles are very touching but then lace does place upon everything a delicate sentiment . Lucky indeed are the families that possess a heritage of lace . A lace bridal veil handed down from mother to daughters , a lace-trimmed Christening robe that each generation wears in turn - these are proud possessions , linked to the exquisite lace-making of the past . But lace-making is by no means a lost art . It suffered a decline and fell into lamentably low standards in the fussy over-furnishing of the Victorian age but it would take more than a temporary lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely , viable craft . It has , in fact , readily adapted itself to modern tastes and the ill- ustrations in the following pages will show how completely it is in sympathy with con- temporary surroundings . It will be seen how , with bold design and rich colour , knitting , crochet and tatting in fine and medium-weight cottons can give striking individuality to many things in the home . Chairbacks , cushions , tablecloths , to mention only three - how satisfying it is to avoid the ready-made in these and by one's own handiwork produce something that reflects true creative talent . The more delicate patterns and finer threads may be reserved to bring a light and lovely touch to personal possessions - a lace border to a handkerchief , fine-lace insertion on a petticoat or blouse , a tatted edge to a collar ; these add a charming , feminine distinction that nothing else can give . Although we assess lace-making as one of the feminine skills , a number of the well-loved traditional patterns that we follow today were , in fact , the brain-children of inventive men . For in the old order of things , men designed and worked lace as well as women and special schools were set up to teach lace- making not only to young girls , but to little boys as well . Whole families made their livelihood by lace-making and consequently a folklore of song , festival and courtship grew up around the lace industry . During the sixteenth century a considerable amount of crochet was produced in the convents of Europe . Without doubt it was the nuns who carried the craft to Ireland . There it was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive form with rosettes , leaves and lace fillings . During the time of Victoria this gentle craft was greatly abused . One can remember with horror the pictures of the overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms complete with heavy crochet antimacassars , mantel- piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and numerous other crocheted pieces . It was some years after the Victorian period that designers realised the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was revived with designs suitable for contemporary trends . Crochet today has a variety of uses , and has even stepped into the field of high fashion . In some of the elegant boutiques of Paris hand-crocheted blouses , gossamer fine in texture , are sold at a very high price . With a little time and concentration the woman at home can produce fashion articles as elegant as those of Paris - a blouse , delicate gloves or a fine edging for collar , cuffs or a handkerchief . In the home , crochet lace can be used to make tablecloths , traycloths and runners , and edgings from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of functions . The art of crochet is not difficult and it is reasonably quick to work . In the following pages simple diagrams and instructions are given to enable the beginner to master all the essential crochet stitches . First launder crochet and then pin to the required shape , ensuring that all lines of the crochet are accurate . Place crochet in correct position on linen and secure with pins . Run a line of basting stitches on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges which are to be attached to the linen . Remove crochet . Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen : ( a ) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches , the knotted part of the button stitch lying on the outside edge . Oversew crochet to button stitch . ( b ) Turn under a small hem , with fold lying on line of basting stitches . Work a row of dc all round this hem , with 3 dc at each corner . Oversew crochet to the dc. A household word , Coats Mercer-Crochet possesses qualities which are of the utmost importance to the worker . It washes beautifully , never loses its colour nor becomes ' stringy ' , is very elastic and preserves the beauty of the design . It is easy to work with , soft , glossy and of uniform thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread . Remember that texture plays an important part in the beauty of crochet . The finer mercerised threads are more effective for the delicate designs used for tablecloths , doilies , edgings and accessories , while the heavier threads are used for bedspreads , chairbacks , luncheon mats , etc. Crochet hooks are made of steel , composition or bone . Steel crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0 , the largest , to number 8 , the smallest . Each size of hook is made for use with a certain size of thread . To ensure the correct results , it is important that you use the size of hook specified in the directions . These are the correct numbers to use with Mercer-Crochet : Directions are given for a small practice piece for each stitch that you learn . When you have become proficient in these stitches , attractive articles can be made from the directions included in this book . 1 . Grasp thread near end between thumb and forefinger . 2 . Make a loop by lapping long thread over short thread . 3 . Hold loop in place between thumb and forefinger ( Fig. 1 ) . 1 . Take hold of broad bar of hook as you would a pencil . Bring middle finger forward to rest near tip of hook . 2 . Insert hook through loop and under long thread . Catch long end of thread ( Fig. 2 ) . Draw loop through . 3 . Do not remove hook from thread . Pull short end and ball thread in opposite directions to bring loop close around the end of the hook , but not too tight ( Fig. 3 ) . Loop thread round little finger , across palm and behind forefinger ( Fig. 4 ) . A great deal of modern furniture has tapered legs , and in reproduction period pieces they are frequently used . The simpler varieties are extremely easy to work , the four sides being simply planed to give the required taper . In the more elaborate varieties , however , a toe is worked in the solid , and this certainly complicates the operation . For short ones a smoothing plane can be used . The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers on the newly planed surfaces , and these treated as before . It is unnecessary to mark the taper with the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces straight . A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom end reveals when the required amount has been removed , and if care is taken to stop the plane short of the squared pencil line at the top , the work will be accurate . The straight-edge can be used to test the straightness of the sides . Incidentally , it is better to complete any mortising that may be needed at the top before the tapering is begun . Some plain tapered legs have the taper on the two inner faces only , the outer surfaces being vertical as at ( B ) , Fig. 1 . To make a leg such as that at ( D ) , Fig. 1 , the square is first marked out as at ( A ) , Fig. 3 . Note that squared lines marking the top member of the toe are needed as well as the upper ex- tent of the taper , and in this case it is necessary to mark in the line of the taper with pencil and straight-edge as at ( B ) , Fig. 3 . A saw cut is made at the upper toe line exactly down to the taper line , no farther . But why woodwork in particular ? Well , there are many reasons . Wood is in good and common supply ; it lends itself to making innumerable useful household items - furniture , fitments , garden items , toys , etc. ; it enables results to be obtained fairly quickly ; it is less expensive than most other materials ; it is a pleasant material to work with ; and , although it does create a certain amount of mess , it is all clean and easily cleared away . This last point is certainly important because almost everyone has come to recognise that machines are not only an economic necessity , but that a great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the installation of a power tool . As an elementary example , surely no one can pretend to enjoy ripping out parts from hardwood . Most men would unhesitatingly use a machine if it were available . Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin with what we have called a bare minimum kit . Probably most men have some of the tools already . It will enable a man to make simple , straight-forward things , and in any case may be regarded as a good beginning to which other tools can be added as the need arises . The nature of the work will probably dictate the additions to be made , but as a guide we have given a fuller kit which increases the range of things that can be made enormously . As a still further development , we follow with a good basic kit , which includes the fuller kit ( which in its turn , of course , includes the bare minimum kit ) . With this the vast majority of jobs can be done , though for advanced cabinet work the necessity for certain special tools will become obvious . Lastly , we suggest certain power tools and machines , the choice of which will depend partly upon the space available in the workshop , the amount one is prepared to pay , and the type of work a man normally does . First , however , a word of advice generally . Do not buy so-called cheap tools or machines . They never are cheap in the long run . They may be inaccurate , Most tools have to lead an intensive life , and faults in design or quality soon become apparent . It is far better to pay the fair price for a tool of good quality , and not handicap yourself from the start . To put it in a slightly different way , do not allow yourself to blame the tools when the job does not turn out quite right ! Many men with only limited accommodation have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table . Providing this is sound , some perfectly good work can be done on it , but the usual problems are those of the vice , the bench stop , and storage place for tools . The combined bench top and tool cupboard shown here has been specially designed and made for WOODWORKER readers who have this difficulty . HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the family man or father-to-be . Unlike many commercial articles , this chair is solidly built and capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the most destructive youngster . Almost any available timber can be used but Parana pine is recommended , being cheap , easy to work , and taking a good finish . Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed timber as shown in Fig. 1 . Although the timber will have already been machine planed , remember to go over each piece with a smoothing plane , otherwise the marks left by the cutters will show up after painting . The dimensions given enable the feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table , but the height can be altered if required . All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned , which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat appearance . The side frames are joined by four cross pieces each 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. by 14 in. which fit into the recesses ( C ) , cut to fit them . See Fig. 2 . These are then glued and pinned into place . A similar piece of 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. by 14 in. timber is fixed across the end of the feeding tray as seen in Fig. 3 which also shows how a piece of hardboard is covered with plastic material for easy cleaning and then fixed underneath the frame with panel pins to complete the feeding tray . Cut this piece of hardboard so that it fits up against the front legs of the chair . The seat rests across the upper two cross pieces and is made of 1/2 in. plywood glued and panel pinned in position , measurements being taken directly from the work . Fig. 4 shows the framework for the back which is made from 1 1/4 in. by 1/2 in. timber . The amount of the backward tilt and also the height is left to personal choice and the width is best taken directly from the work to ensure a good fit . Fix the piece A to the sides first with glue and panel pins and then fit the frame together with the piece B temporarily in place on the chair frame . Decide on the required angle of slope , keeping B flat on the chair seat , and mark off the exact position of B on the side pieces . These can then be cut at the correct angle and B is glued and nailed in place . A piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned to the frame and its edges planed off flush . Finally attach the back firmly to the sides with screws driven from the inside . The footrest is a piece of timber 14 in. long and about 1/2 in. by 4 in. attached to the front legs with a pair of angle irons as shown in Fig. 5 . When determining the position of the footrest , do not place too near the seat to allow for the growth of baby's legs . To complete the job , screw two fittings to the inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the back to hold the baby's safety harness . These can be made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout wire as shown in Fig. 6 . Make sure that these are well secured as they will have to withstand considerable pulling as the child becomes older . Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes with plastic wood . Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole framework and round off any sharp edges ( such as the edge of the seat , feeding tray , etc ) . Fill the grain with a woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in a suitable pastel shade , using a contrasting colour for the seat and the back which can be decorated with a suitable nursery transfer . Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous if junior decides to bite the chair . Finally , it is as well to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective material that might be available as otherwise the paint would soon be scratched off . ( J.H.P. ) BUILDING your own boat is a most satisfying and worthwhile project . Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little rowing dinghy many of which I have built and sold . It is especially designed for simplicity in construction , cheapness and lightness of weight , and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people and an outboard motor with a comfortable margin of freeboard . For instance , in Canada we use galvanised nails in place of screws . We just bend them over and clamp firmly by using a hammer on each side . Over here I 've always used brass screws , which are more expensive . The first job is to make your moulds . In Fig. 1 it quotes 3/4 in. five-ply , but to save money any scrap may be used , and if this is nailed and glued together strongly , it may be marked and cut to shape later . If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor the moulds , make a frame of rough lumber as shown in Fig. 2 . The main idea is to have the moulds standing as rigid as possible , for it is on these you will be building and shaping your little craft , upside-down . For cheapness I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British Columbia . This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure a permanently water proof glue line . Be sure to see that the edge bears the mark , P.M.B.C. Exterior . This may be bought at any good timber merchants . The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply wood of the same make , or oak or mahogany . For the last one I made , I used the two flaps from an old mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one shilling . I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for rowing this dinghy ( Fig. 3 ) . They are very simple , cheap and easy to make . As will be seen from the plan there is only a single gunwale on the outside . I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada is difficult to obtain here and expensive . I overcome this in another way as shown in Fig. 4 . Cut the moulds and the transoms to shape as in the detailed drawings . If you have a wooden floor you can use ' A ' frames fastened to the floor if not , use a strong horizontal frame that will sit firmly on the ground or concrete floor . I use a heavy old base as in Fig. 2 . The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to correspond to the sides and bottom of the boat . Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould to allow for the chines to rest in these notches , as they are not fastened to the moulds , which will only be used whilst the hull is under construction . The chine is the long stringer on each side which is joined to both transoms and lies in the grooves cut in the moulds . Each chine is made of oak , ash , spruce or any long grained flexible wood . I prefer spruce when available . As will be seen in the plan , the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in. on each side . The chines are morticed into this and butt up against the transom . Start at the bow and spring them both at the same time over the slots cut in the moulds and into the notches cut for this purpose in the stern or after transom framing . Glue , screw and make fast . The skeleton of the boat will now take shape , and this is the time to check before making fast to see that nothing is distorted . Ensure that the outside measurements from transom to transom are equal on each side and that the transoms are parallel horizontally . Next bevel the chines with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly . Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for planing after fixing to the boat . Use your two lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this purpose , the sides from one , and the bottom from the other . If care is taken not to waste the ply , plenty of material is left over for the thwarts . Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready to plank the sides . Start again at the bows , clamping into position with a ' D ' clamp . Bend round the frame to the stern and clamp there . If you have a third clamp use it in the centre as well . After generously covering with glue , screw the sides to the transom framing and the chine . Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass ) or nail with inch and a quarter galvanized nails , if you are doing it that way . Use flat head screws about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in the 1/4 in. ply . Make a very small hole for the screw to allow for a good grip . Remember to glue before screwing . Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom , which is cut in one piece . It should overlap just a trifle ; this can be cleaned up later . As you are screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with the screws . I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for the bottom , both for screwing to the chines and the bottom shaped transom facing . Again , don't forget to glue . Now put on the keel and the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off the moulds . You won't want them again for this boat , so shift them right out of the way . Place the boat right side up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for working . Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts ( seats ) taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats with vertical members as shown in the plans . Make the four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside ( gunwale ) one to fit the block . I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull with copper nails and roves . It greatly improves the appearance and the strength . Paint with good marine primer , undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint . WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either making fabric pictures or designs . While these may ultimately be made into a picture for framing and hanging on a wall , they may also be arranged into a design , and the resulting panel utilized for decorating a useful article . This could hardly happen without the herring having some orientation with the sea bottom . It means that the crowding is caused during the daytime , and that the herring must continue to migrate over the ground as well as in midwater and during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia is always from the north ) . Thus we can see that herring movements , although primarily instinctive perhaps , and certainly helped and hindered by water flow , are also closely related to the sea-bed geography . Geography , too , names the great fisheries that depend on them : the Fladen Ground ( where again most big shots are taken on the edges ) , the Gut , a deep-water channel to the Dogger where the herring spawn along the northern The effect of bottom congestion due to the light pressure is inevitably mixed with that of the suitability of ground for spawning . Both result in crowding , so there is no need to try to separate them - thank Heaven ! A good picture of this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning grounds from the Viking in the north down to the Klondykes and the Reef along the western edge of the Norwegian Deep . In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom . Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure . But they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the echo-sounders . Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring- spawning herring are always found . The joint evidence of echo-sounders and fishing gear leads to an overall though somewhat dim picture . The details are harder still to see . Drift Effects . At East Anglia , for instance , shoals that gather at the Knoll or other banks are most of them going to travel a hundred miles farther south before they spawn . Some will spawn at the So the arrival of any particular shoal fish at a certain spawning ground may be accidental . Yet there will always be some that find it if enough are travelling , just as the robin who gets back exactly may be only one among thousands who do not . But this southerly migration is not accidental . Being contranatant or against the drift , it probably has a survival value in ensuring that the fry after hatching are drifted back into the normal home Drift in another form probably explains how these migrating herring are biased to east or west by the different winds . Strong westerlies are well known to bring good longshore fishings . The surface water that is blown offshore must be replaced by an underflow bringing with it the herring to the Norfolk and Suffolk beaches . Easterly winds , on the other hand , mean no herring along the shore , as recent years have shown . A succession of winds is needed for this effect of course - one breeze will not do it , though a very hard westerly will often start off the " local " herring ; but quite apart from this wind effect there is an easterly drift special to this rump of coastline , caused by the meeting of water from north and south . Herring fishermen call this " the outset " . It is strongest at spring tides , when without wind you will " set " out - or drift to the east- ward , the length of half a fleet of nets - almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's Knoll . Without an explanation of how it works , it may well be that this outset , akin to the mouth of a great salmon river , has been the biggest factor through the ages in the constancy of this great herring fishery . The East Anglian behaviour ( see p. 82 ) has always differed from that of the summer fisheries . There is the " swim " at slack waters , even in daylight sometimes ; and the high swimming , when fish are caught only in the top few yards of netting . These and other fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar to this fishery , which unfortunately seems to be dying out ; but a full discussion of them is beyond the present scope . The Bow-wave Theory . This assumes that all fishing gear , when moving , sends before it a kind of scaring effect , probably through waves or vibrations in the water or along the ground . Underwater films suggest that the footrope of a trawl does this . Films have also shown plaice moving before a seine net in just the same way after being gathered inwards by the ropes . ( Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved ; it may be by actual contact , or by sight reaction to the disturbed sand ; or even in the case of flat fish , by vibrations through or along the bottom . ) But given such a bow wave of disturbance , it is obvious that without something to overcome its effect , very few fish would be caught . Let us consider first what would appear to be the simplest case - that of flat fish on the bottom . The evidence suggest that the fish are aware of the moving footrope before it reaches them . They move away before it , swimming at the same speed for an unknown period of time , until they become ( 1 ) tired , or ( 2 ) more used to the disturbance . Then they stop swimming and are caught . In the seine-net film this usually seemed to happen just after the fish had risen above the footrope , and presumably out of its field of disturbance , or bow wave . This suggests that the wave might be transmitted by the sea-bed , though the footrope in this case was actually just off the bottom and was indeed passing over some fish . Actually the seine net has little or no cover . And in this film the rise of the fish was small , a matter of a foot or two . With round fish like haddock , which would hardly find safety on the bottom , this cover would seem to be even more essential ; but more films are needed to prove this . Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered essential to catch round fish whose reaction to disturbance would be upwards . WE have not yet reached the stage in Britain when 50 planes are engaged in spreading 1,500 tons of DDT and fuel oil over 3 million acres or when 20 million acres are sprayed with dieldrin . An eye- witness described one sprayed area as literally rank with the stench of small game and birds dead from insecti- cide poisoning . Wholesale chemical spraying , upsetting as it does the balance of nature by killing both pests and predators , is viewed with concern by a number of American State Research Stations . Not content with issuing bulletins on the dangers of the misuse of chemicals in agriculture , some stations are carrying out useful research on pest control by biological means . Both native and imported predatory insects and insect pathogens are used in field trial tests . The biological control of pests in the garden is not new to the American gardener . Lady- birds figure in press advertisements , their sale being by the gallon . Praying mantis ( Mantis religiosa ) , both native and " immigrant " varieties , are used by gardeners in all parts of the United States . Advertisements offer eggs of European , Chinese or native forms of mantis . From the day it hatches in the spring until it dies in the late autumn , the praying mantis satisfies its voracity by eating other insects . Nine blowflies may be consumed at one sitting and the fully adult , 2 1/2-in.-long insect , is able to keep a firm hold on one grasshopper while eating another . According to Dr. Max Beier in " Fang- heuschrecken " ( Die Neue Brehm Bu"ckerei , 1952 ) , the praying mantis is trecking northwards . Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an egg-case of the Chinese mantis . The first mantis had hatched from the very large egg-case on June 6 . Both the Chinese and Spanish mantis , in the young stage at any rate , are light brown in colour . Because of the cool , wet weather , I had great difficulty in breeding fruit flies and , after many of the mantis of both types had died in my Kilner jars , I poured living mantis over vines and peachtrees . A Gardeners Chronicle reader living in Grantham , Lincs , kindly offered to cooperate with me in studying praying mantis as a pest control in the cold greenhouse . Of the dozen Spanish mantis sent him by post on June 22 , only two or three survived the journey ; one thrived and the latest report I have is that this mantis is still alive . DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes since the end of the war , clay pots are still in greatest demand . It is mostly in the smaller sizes that the substitutes have made headway , and although numerous small clay pots are used each year , they are fewer than they were 10 years ago . In the larger sizes there is still no real substitute for clay that can be obtained at a comparable
